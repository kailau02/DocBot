I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried\\ndeep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the\\nstudio were Jewish. It\\'s much ado about nothing. I never once had a\\nproblem with him in that way.\"[172][ab] In addition songwriter Robert B.\\nSherman  recalled that when one of Disney\\'s lawyers made anti-Semitic\\nremarks towards him and his brother Richard , Disney defended them and\\nfired the attorney.[194][172] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted\\naccess to the Disney archives, conc ludes that the available evidence does\\nnot support accusations of anti-Sem itism and that Disney largely got that\\nreputation due to his association with Motion Picture Alliance for the\\nPreservation of American Ideals  – an anti-Communist organization formed\\nin 1944, that was rumored to have anti-Semitic undertones.

New animated and\\nlive-action films  followed  after World War II, including the critically\\nsuccessful Cinderella  (1950), Sleeping Beauty  (1959) and Mary Poppins\\n(1964), the last of which received five Academy Awards.\\nIn the 1950s, Disn ey expanded into the amusement park  industry, and in\\nJuly 1955 he opened Disneyland  in Anaheim, California .

In 1965,  he began development of another theme park, Disney World ,\\nthe heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"Experimental Prototype\\nCommunity of Tomorrow \" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker\\nthroughout his life and died of lung cancer in 1966 before either the park or\\nthe EPCOT project were completed.\\nDisney\\'s childhood homeDisney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted\\na warm and outg oing public persona. He had high standards and high\\nexpectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been\\naccusations that he was racist  or antisemitic , they have been contradicted\\nby many who knew him. Historiography of Disney has taken a variety of\\nperspectives, rang ing from views of him as a purveyor of homely patriotic\\nvalues  to being a repres entative of American cultural imperialism . Wid ely\\nconsidered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th\\ncentury, Disney remains an important presence in the history of animation\\nand in the cultural history of the United States , where he is acknowledged\\nas a national cultural icon . His film work continues to be shown and\\nadapted, the Disney theme parks have grown in size and number to attract\\nvisitors in several countries and his company has grown to become one of\\nthe world\\'s largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates .\\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901,\\nat 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago\\'s\\nHermosa  neighborhood.[b] He was the\\nfourth son of Elias Disney — born in the\\nProvince of Canada , to Irish  parents — \\nand Flora (née Call), an Americ an of\\nGerman and English descent.[4][5][c]\\nAside from Walt, Elias and Flora\\'s sons\\nwere Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and\\nthe couple had a fifth child, Ruth , in\\nDecember 1903.[8] In 1906, when\\nDisney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missou ri, where\\nhis uncle  Robert had just purchased  land. In Marceline, Disney developed\\nhis interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired\\nneighborhood doctor.[9] Elias was a subs criber to the Appeal to Reason\\nnewspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-pageEarly life\\ncartoons of Ryan Walker.[10] He also began to develop an abilit y to work\\nwith watercolors and crayons.[5] He lived  near the Atchison, Topeka and\\nSanta Fe Railway  line and became enamored with trains.[11] He and his\\nyounger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School  in\\nMarceline in late 1909.[12] The Disney fami ly were active members of a\\nCongregational church .[13]\\nIn 1911, the Disn eys moved to Kansas City, Missouri .[14] There, Disney\\nattended the Benton Grammar School , where he met fellow-student Walte r\\nPfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the\\nworld of vaudeville  and motion pictures. Before long, Disney was spending\\nmore time at the Pfeiffers\\' house than at home.[15] Elias had purchased a\\nnewspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star  and Kansas City Times .\\nDisney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the\\nTimes  before school and repeated the round for the evening Star  after\\nschool. The schedule was exhausting , and Disney often received poor grades\\nafter falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than\\nsix years.[16] He atten ded Satu rday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute\\nand also took a correspondence course  in cartooning.[5][17]\\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company,\\nand moved back to the city with his family.[18] Disn ey enrolled at McKinley\\nHigh School  and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing\\npatriotic pictures about World War I;[19][20] he also took night courses at\\nthe Chicago Academy of Fine Arts .[21] In mid-1918, he attempted to join the\\nUnited States Army  to fight the Germans , but he was rejected as too young.\\nAfter forging the date of birth  on his birth certificate, he joined the Red\\nCross  in Septem ber 1918  as an ambulance  driver. He was shipped to France\\nbut arrive d in November, after the armis tice.[22] He drew cartoons on the\\nside of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in\\nthe army  newspaper Stars and Stripes .[23] He returned to Kansas City in\\nOctober 1919,[24] where he worked  as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-\\nWalt Disney\\'s business envelope\\nfeatured a self-portrait, c.\\u20091921.Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for\\nadvertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub\\nIwerks .[25]\\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin\\'s\\nrevenue declined  after Christmas,\\nDisney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid\\noff. They started their own business, the\\nshort-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial\\nArtists.[26] Failing to attract many\\ncustomers, Disney and Iwerks agreed\\nthat Disney should leave temporaril y to\\nearn money at the Kansas City Film Ad\\nCompany, run by A. V. Cauger; the\\nfollowing month Iwerks, who was not\\nable to run their business alone, also joined.[27] The company produced\\ncommercials using the cutout animation  technique.[28] Disney became\\ninterested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt\\nand Jeff and Max Fleischer \\'s Out of the Inkwell . With the assistance of a\\nborrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at\\nhome.[29][d] He came to the conclusion that cel anim ation  was more\\npromising than the cutout method.[e] Unable to persuad e Cauger to try cel\\nanimation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-wor ker\\nfrom the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman .[31] Their main client was the local\\nNewman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as\\n\"Newman\\'s Laugh -O-Grams\".[32] Disney studied Paul Terry\\'s  Aesop\\'s\\nFables  as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized\\nfairy tales.[33]Career\\nEarly career: 1920–1928\\nIn May 1921, the success of the \"Lau gh-O-Grams\" led to the establishment\\nof Laugh-O-Gram Studio , for which he hired more animators, including\\nFred Harman\\'s brother Hugh , Rudolf Ising  and Iwerks.[34] The Laugh-O-\\nGrams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the compa ny\\nsolvent, so Disney started production of Alice\\'s Wonderland  — based on\\nAlice\\'s Adventures in Wonderlan d — which combined live action with\\nanimation; he cast Virginia Davis  in the title role.[35] The result, a 12½-\\nminute, one-reel  film, was compl eted too late to save Laugh-O-Gram\\nStudio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.[36]\\nDisney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New\\nYork was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles\\nbecause his brothe r Roy was conval escing from tuberculosis  there,[37] and\\nhe hoped  to become a live-action film director.[38] Disney\\'s  efforts to sell\\nAlice\\'s Wonderland  were in vain until he heard from  New York film\\ndistributor Margaret J. Winkler . She was losing the rights to both the Out of\\nthe Inkwell  and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In\\nOctober, they signed a contract for six Alice  comedies , with an option for\\ntwo further series of six episodes each.[38][39] Disney and his brother Roy\\nformed the Disney Brothers Studio — which later became The Walt  Disney\\nCompany — to produce the films;[40][41] they persuaded Davis and her\\nfamily to relocate to Hollywood  to conti nue prod uction, with Davis on\\ncontract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwer ks,\\npersuading him to relocate to Hollyw ood from Kansas City.[42] In 1926,[43]\\nthe first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyper ion\\nAvenue; the building was demolished in 1940.[44]\\nBy 1926,  Winkler \\'s role in the distribution of the Alice  series had been\\nhanded over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although  the\\nrelationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.[45] The\\nseries ran until July 1927,[46] by which time Disney had begun to tire of it\\nand want ed to move away from the mixed format to all animation.[45][47]\\nAfter Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal\\nPictures , Disney and Iwer ks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , a character\\nDisney wanted to be \"peppy, alert,  saucy and venturesome, keeping him\\nalso neat and trim\".[47][48]\\nIn February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the\\nOswald  series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had\\nalso persuaded many of the artist s involved to work directly for him,\\nincluding Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell  and Friz Freleng . Disney also\\nfound out that Universal owned the intellectual proper ty rights  to Oswald.\\nMintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if\\nDisney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz\\'s ultimat um\\nand lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain\\nwith him.[49][50][f]\\nTo replac e Oswald , Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse , possibly\\ninspired by a pet mouse that Disn ey had adopted while working in his\\nLaugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are\\nunclear.[52][g] Disney\\'s  original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but\\nhis wife Lillian  thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey\\ninstead.[53][h] Iwerks revised Disney\\'s provisional sketches to make the\\ncharacter easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself\\nfrom the animatio n process,[55] provided  Mickey\\'s voice until 1947.  In the\\nwords of one Disn ey employee, \"Ub designed Mickey\\'s physical appearan ce,\\nbut Walt gave him his soul.\"[56]\\nMickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the\\nshort Plane Crazy , but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin\\' Gaucho ,\\nfailed to find a distributor.[57] Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz\\nSinger , Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat\\nWillie , to create the first post-produced sound cartoon . After the animationCreation of Mickey Mouse and following successes: 1928–\\n1934\\nThe first appearance of Mickey\\nMouse, in Steamboat Willie (1928)was complete, Disney signed a cont ract\\nwith the former executive of Universal\\nPictures, Pat Powers , to use the \"Powers\\nCinephone\" recording system;[58]\\nCinephone became the new distributor\\nfor Disney\\'s early sound cartoons, which\\nsoon became popular.[59]\\nTo improve the quality of the music,\\nDisney hired the professional composer\\nand arra nger Carl Stalling, on whose\\nsuggestion the Silly Symphony  series\\nwas developed, providing stories\\nthrough the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance  (1929),\\nwas drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were\\nseveral artists, both local and from New York.[60] Both the Mickey Mouse\\nand Silly Sym phonies  series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt\\nthey were  not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930,\\nDisney tried to trim  costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the\\npractice of drawing every frame individually in favor of the more effici ent\\ntechnique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the inbetween\\nposes . Disney asked Powers for an increa se in payments for the cartoons.\\nPowers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly\\nafterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.[61]\\nDisney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931 — which he blamed on the\\nmachinations of Powers and his own overwork — so he and Lillian took an\\nextended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.[62]\\nWith the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with\\nColumbia Pictures  to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became\\nincreasingly popu lar, including internationally.[63][64][i] Disney and his\\ncrew also introduc ed new cartoon stars like Pluto  in 1930, Goofy  in 1932\\nand Donald Duck in 1934.[65] Always keen to embrace new technology and\\nencouraged by his new contract with  United Artists , Disney filmed Flowers\\n7:47CC\\nand Tree s (1932) in full-colo r three-strip Technicolor ;[66] he was also able\\nto negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process\\nuntil August 31, 1935.[67] All subsequent Silly Sym phony  cartoons  were in\\ncolor.[68] Flowers and Trees  was popular with audiences[69] and won the\\ninaugural Academy Award  for best Short Subject (Cartoon)  at the 1932\\nceremony . Disney had been nominated for another film in that category,\\nMickey\\'s Orphans , and received an Honorary Award  \"for the creation of\\nMickey Mouse\".[70][71]\\nIn 1933, Disney produced The Thre e Little Pigs , a film described by the\\nmedia historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all\\ntime\".[72] The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short\\nSubject (Cartoon) category. The film\\'s success led to a further increase in\\nthe studi o\\'s staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year.[73]\\nDisney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that\\nwould interest the audience,[74] and he invested in a \"story depart ment\"\\nseparate from the animators, with storyboard artists  who would detail the\\nplots of Disney\\'s films.[75]\\nBy 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing cartoon shorts,[65]\\nand belie ved a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable.[76] The\\nstudio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven\\nDwarfs , based on the fairy tale. When news leak ed out about the project,\\nmany in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company;\\nindustry insiders nicknamed it \"Disn ey\\'s Folly\".[77] The film, which was the\\nfirst anim ated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to\\nproduce — three times over budget.[78] To ensure the animation was as\\nrealistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard\\nArt Institute ;[79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that\\nthe anima tors could study realistic movement.[80] To portray the changing\\nperspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disne y\\'sGolden age of animation: 1934–1941\\nWalt Disney introduces each of the\\nseven dwarfs in a scene from the\\noriginal 1937 Snow White theatrical\\ntrailer.animators developed a multiplane\\ncamera  which allowed drawings on\\npieces of glass to be set at various\\ndistances from the camera, creating an\\nillusion of depth. The glass could be\\nmoved to create the impression of a\\ncamera passing through the scene. The\\nfirst work created on the camera — a\\nSilly Symphony  called The Old Mill\\n(1937) — won the Academy Award for\\nAnimated Short Film because of its\\nimpressive visual power. Although\\nSnow White  had been largely finished\\nby the time the multiplane camera had\\nbeen completed, Disney ordered som e scenes be re-drawn to use the new\\neffects.[81]\\nSnow White  premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and\\naudiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and\\nby May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful\\nsound film made to that date.[77][j] Disney won anoth er Honorary Academy\\nAward, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar\\nstatuettes.[83][k] The success of Snow White heralded  one of the most\\nproductive eras for the studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum  calls the\\nfollowing years \"the \\'Golden Age of Animation\\' \".[84][85] With work on Snow\\nWhite  finished, the studio began producing Pinocchio  in early 1938 and\\nFantasia  in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940,\\nand neither performed well at the box office — partly because revenues from\\nEurope had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio\\nincurred a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of\\nFebruary 1941.[86]\\nDisney drawing Goofy for a\\ngroup of girls in Argentina,\\n1941In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the\\ncompany\\'s first public stock offering  in 1940, and impl emented heavy salary\\ncuts. The latter measure, and Disney\\'s sometimes high-handed and\\ninsensitive manne r of dealing with  staff, led to a 1941 animators\\' strike\\nwhich lasted five weeks.[87] While a federal mediator from the National\\nLabor Relations Board  negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an\\noffer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs  to make a\\ngoodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolut ion\\nhe knew would be unfavorable to the studio.[88][l] Due to the strike — and\\nthe financial state of the company — several animators left the studio, and\\nDisney\\'s relationsh ip with other members of staff was permanently strained\\nas a result.[91] The strike temporarily interrupted the studio\\'s next\\nproduction, Dumbo  (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and\\ninexpensive mann er; the film receiv ed a positive reaction from audien ces\\nand critics alike.[92]\\nShortly after the release of Dumbo  in October\\n1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney\\nformed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit\\nwithin the company to produce instruction\\nfilms for the military such as Four Methods of\\nFlush Riveting  and Aircraft Production\\nMethods .[93] Disney also met with Henry\\nMorgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury ,\\nand agreed to produce short Donald Duck\\ncartoons to promote war bonds .[94] Disney also\\nproduced several  propaganda prod uctions ,\\nincluding shorts such as Der Fueh rer\\'s Face — \\nwhich won an Academy Award — and the 1943\\nfeature film Victory Through Air Power .[95]World War II and beyond: 1941–1950\\nThe milit ary films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the\\nfeature film Bambi  — which had been in production since 1937 — \\nunderperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box\\noffice.[96] On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio  and Fantasia , the\\ncompany had debts of $4 million with the Bank of America  in 1944.[97][m]\\nAt a mee ting with  Bank of America  executives to discuss the future of the\\ncompany, the bank\\'s chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini , told his\\nexecutives, \"I\\'ve been watching the Disneys\\' pictures quite closely because I\\nknew we were lending them money far above the financial risk. ... They\\'re\\ngood this year, they\\'re good next year, and they\\'re good the year after. ...\\nYou have  to relax and give them time to market their product.\"[98] Disney\\'s\\nproduction of short films decrease d in the late 1940s, coinciding with\\nincreasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros.  and\\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer . Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more\\ncombined animat ion and live-action productions.[58][n] In 1948, Disney\\ninitiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life\\nAdventures , with  Seal Islan d the first;  the film won the Academy  Award in\\nthe Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)  category.[99]\\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella , his studio\\'s first animated\\nfeature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audienc es.\\nCosting $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first\\nyear.[100][o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous\\npictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature,\\nTreasure Island  (1950), which was shot in Britain , as was The Stor y of\\nRobin Hood and His Merrie Men  (1952).[101] Other all-live-action features\\nfollowed, many of which had patriotic themes.[58][p] He continued to\\nproduce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland\\n(1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to\\ndevote less attention to the animati on department, entrusting most of its\\noperations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men ,[q] although  he wasTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\\nDisney shows the plans of\\nDisneyland to officials from Orange\\nCounty in December 1954always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other\\nventures.[102] Around the sam e time, Disney established his own film\\ndistribution division Buena Vista , replacing his most recent distributor\\nRKO Pictures .[103]\\nFor several years Disney had been\\nconsidering building a theme park.\\nWhen he visited Griffith Park  in Los\\nAngeles with his daughters, he wan ted\\nto be in a clean, unspoiled park, where\\nboth children and their parents could\\nhave fun.[104] He visited the Tivoli\\nGardens  in Copenhagen, Denmark, and\\nwas heavily influenced by the\\ncleanliness and layout of the park.[105]\\nIn March 1952, he received zoning\\npermission to build a theme park in\\nBurbank, near the Disney studios.[106]\\nThis site proved too small, and a larger\\nplot in Anaheim , 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased. To\\ndistance the project from the studio  — which might attract the criticism of\\nshareholders — Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney\\nImagineering ) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and\\nanimators to work on the plans;[107][108] those involved became known as\\n\"Imagineers\".[109] After obtaining bank funding  he invited other\\nstockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres — part of\\nAmerican Broadc asting Company  (ABC) — and Western Printing  and\\nLithographing Company .[58] In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to\\nevery amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfa lls\\nor proble ms there were in the various locations and incorporated their\\nfindings into his design.[110] Construc tion work started in July 1954, and\\nDisneyland  opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on\\nABC, which reached 70 million viewers.[111] The park was designed as a\\nseries of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A. — a replica\\nof the main street in his hometown  of Marceline. The connected themed\\nareas were Adventureland , Frontierland , Fantasyland  and Tomorrowland .\\nThe park also contained the narrow gauge  Disneyland Railroad  that linked\\nthe lands ; around the outside of the park was a high berm  to separate the\\npark from the outside world.[112][113] An edito rial in The New York Times\\nconsidered that Disney had \"tastefully combined some of the pleas ant\\nthings of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow\".[114] Although\\nthere were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a\\nmonth\\'s operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by\\nthe end of its first year, it attracted 3.6 million guests.[115]\\nThe money from ABC was continge nt on Disney television programs.[116]\\nThe studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christm as\\nDay 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland . Roy believed the\\nprogram added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to\\nshareholders, he wrote that \"television can be a most powerful selling aid\\nfor us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise\\nthat we enter television when we do\".[58] In 1954, after the Disneyland\\nfunding had been agreed, ABC broadcast Walt Disney\\'s Disneyland , an\\nanthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other\\nmaterial from the studio\\'s library. The show was successful in terms of\\nratings and profits, earning an audi ence share of over 50%.[117][r] In April\\n1955, Newsweek  called the series an \"American institution\".[118] ABC was\\npleased with the ratings, leading to Disney\\'s first daily television program,\\nThe Mick ey Mouse Club , a variety show catering specifically to children.[119]\\nThe program was accompanied by merchandising through vario us\\ncompanies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring\\nbooks and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connec ted\\nto the show).[120] One of the segments of Disneyland  consisted of the five-\\npart miniseries  Davy Crockett  which, according to Disney biograp her Neal\\nGabler , \"became an overnight sensation\".[121] The show\\'s theme song, \"The\\nDisney in 1954Ballad of Davy Crockett \", became internationally popular, and ten million\\nrecords were sold.[122] As a result, Disney formed his own record\\nproduction and distribution entity, Disneyland Records .[123]\\nAs well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects\\naway from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 American National\\nExhibition  in Moscow; Disney Studios\\' contribution was America the\\nBeautiful , a 19-minute film in the 360-degre e Circarama theater  that was\\none of the most popular attractions.[58] The follo wing year he acted as the\\nchairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Win ter Olympics  in\\nSquaw Valley, California , where he designe d the opening, closing and medal\\nceremonies .[124] He was one of twelve investors in the Celebrity Sports\\nCenter , which opened in 1960 in Glendale, Colorad o; he and Roy bought\\nout the others in 1962, making the Disney company the sole owner.[125]\\nDespite the demands wrought by non-studio\\nprojects, Disney continued to work on film and\\ntelevision projects. In 1955, he was involved in\\n\"Man in Space \", an episode of the Disneyland\\nseries, which was made in collabor ation with\\nNASA  rocket designer Wernher von Braun .[s]\\nDisney also oversa w aspects of the full-length\\nfeatures Lady and the Tramp  (the first\\nanimated film in CinemaScope ) in 1955,\\nSleeping Beauty  (the first anima ted film in\\nTechnirama  70 mm film) in 1959, One\\nHundred and One Dalmatians  (the first\\nanimated feature film to use Xerox cels) in\\n1961, and The Sword in the Stone  in 1963.[127]\\nIn 1964, Disney produced Mary Poppins , based on the book series  by P. L.\\nTravers ; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the\\n1940s.[128] It becam e the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although\\nTravers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights.[129]\\nThe same  year he also became invo lved in plans to expand the California\\nInstitute of the Arts  (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw\\nup blueprints for a new building.[130]\\nDisney provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair, for\\nwhich he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo ,\\nwho plan ned a tribute to UNICEF , Disney developed It\\'s a Small World , a\\nboat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world;\\nGreat Moments with Mr. Lincoln  contained an animatronic Abraham\\nLincoln  giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress  promoted\\nthe importance of electricity; and Ford\\'s Magic Skyway portrayed the\\nprogress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibits — principally concepts\\nand technology — were re-installed in Disneyland, although It\\'s a Small\\nWorld is the ride that most closely resembles the original.[131][132]\\nDuring the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a ski resort  in\\nMineral King, a glacial  valley in California\\'s Sierra Nevada . He hired  experts\\nsuch as the reno wned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy\\nSchaeffler .[133] [134][t] With income from Disneyland accounting for an\\nincreasing proportion of the studio\\'s income, Disney continued to look for\\nvenues for other attractions. In 1963, he presented a project to creat e a\\ntheme park in downtown St. Louis , Missouri; he initially reached an\\nagreement with the Civic Center Redevelopment Corp, which controlled the\\nland, but the deal later collapsed over funding.[136][137] In late 1965, he\\nannounced plans to develop anoth er theme park to be called \"Disney\\nWorld\" (now Walt Disney World ), a few miles southwest of Orlando,\\nFlorida . Disney World was to include the \"Magic Kingdom\" — a larger and\\nmore elab orate version of Disneyland — plus golf courses and resort hotels.\\nThe hear t of Disney World was to be the \"Experimental Prototy pe\\nCommunity of Tomorrow\" ( EPCOT ),[138] which he described as:\\nan experimental prototype commu nity of tomorrow that will\\ntake its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are\\nnow emer ging from the creative centers of American industry. It\\nGrave of Walt Disney at\\nForest Lawn, Glendalewill be a commun ity of tomorrow that will never be completed,\\nbut will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating\\nnew materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a\\nshowcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of\\nAmerican free enterprise.[139]\\nDuring 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT.[140]\\nHe receiv ed a story credit in the 1966 film Lt. Robin  Crusoe, U.S.N.  as\\nRetlaw Yensid, his name spelt backw ards.[141] He incre ased his involvement\\nin the studio\\'s films, and was heavil y involved in the story development  of\\nThe Jungle Book , the live-action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire\\n(both 1967) and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\\n(1968).[142]\\nDisney had been a heavy smoker  since World\\nWar I. He did not use cigarettes with filters  and\\nhad smok ed a pipe as a young man. In early\\nNovember 1966, he was diagnosed  with lung\\ncancer  and was treated with cobalt therapy . On\\nNovember 30, he felt unwell and was taken by\\nambulance from his home to St. Joseph\\nHospital  where, on December 15, at age 65, he\\ndied of circulatory collap se caused by the\\ncancer.[143] His remains were cremated two\\ndays later and his ashes interred at the Forest\\nLawn Memorial Park  in Glendale,\\nCalifornia .[144][u]\\nThe release of The Jungle Book  and The Happiest Millionaire  in 1967\\nraised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to\\n81.[19] When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day  was released in 1968, itIllness, death and aftermath\\nExternal videos\\n Interview with Neal Gabler on\\nWalt Disney: The Triumph of the\\nAmerican Imagination, November\\n19, 2006 (https://www.c-span.org/vid\\neo/?195399-10/walt-disney), C-\\nSPANearned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category,\\nawarded posthumously.[148] After Disney\\'s death, his studios continued to\\nproduce live-action films prolificall y while the quality of their animated\\nfilms was allowed to languish. In the late 1980s, this trend was reversed in\\nwhat The New  York Times  describe s as the \"Disney Renaissance \" that\\nbegan with The Little Mermaid  (1989).[149] Disney\\'s studios continue to\\nproduce successful film, television and stage entertainment.[150]\\nDisney\\'s plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition.\\nAfter Disney\\'s death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full\\ncontrol of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a\\ntown to an attraction.[151] At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt\\nDisney World to his brother.[152][v] Walt Disney Wor ld expanded with the\\nopening of Epcot Center  in 1982;  Walt Disney\\'s vision of a functional city\\nwas replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world\\'s fair.[154] In 2009,\\nthe Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney\\'s daughter Diane and\\nher son Walter E. D. Miller, opened  in the Presidio of San Francisco .[155]\\nThousands of artifacts from Disney\\'s life and career are on display,\\nincluding numerous awards that he received.[156] In 2014, the Disne y theme\\nparks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.[157]\\nEarly in 1925, Disney hired an ink\\nartist, Lillian Bounds . They married in\\nJuly of that year, at her brothe r\\'s\\nhouse in her home town of Lewiston,\\nIdaho .[158] The marriage was generally\\nhappy, according to Lillian, although\\naccording to Disney\\'s biographer Neal\\nGabler  she did not \"accept Walt\\'s\\ndecisions meekly or his status\\nunquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people \\'howPersonal life and character\\nDisney family at Schiphol Airport\\n(1951)henpecked he is\\'.\"[159][w] Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood\\nsocial scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts,\\n\"content with household management and providing support for her\\nhusband\".[160] Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane  (born\\nDecember 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks\\npreviously).[161][x] Within the famil y, neither Disney nor his wife hid the\\nfact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people\\noutside the family raised the point.[162] The Disneys were  careful to keep\\ntheir daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the\\nlight of the Lindbergh kidnap ping ; Disney took steps to ensure his\\ndaughters were not photographed by the press.[163]\\nIn 1949, Disney and his family move d to\\na new home in the Holmby Hills  district\\nof Los Angeles. With the help of his\\nfriends Ward and Betty Kimball , who\\nalready had their own backyard\\nrailroad , Disney developed blueprints\\nand immediately set to work on creating\\na miniature live steam  railroad for his\\nback yard. The name of the railroad,\\nCarolwood Pacific Railroad , came from\\nhis home\\'s location on Carolwood Drive.\\nThe miniature working steam\\nlocomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie , and\\nDisney named it Lilly Belle after his wife;[164] after three years Disney\\nordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.[165]\\nDisney grew more politically conserv ative  as he got older. A Democratic\\nParty  supporter until the 1940 presidential election , when he switched\\nallegiance to the Republican Party ,[166] he beca me a generous donor to\\nThomas E. Dewey \\'s 1944 bid for the presidency .[167] In 1946, he was a\\nfounding member  of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of\\nAmerican Ideals , an orga nization who stated they \"believ[ed] in, and like,\\nthe Amer ican Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt agains t a\\nrising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by\\nsubversive means to undermine and change this way of life\".[168] In 1947,\\nduring the Second Red Scare , Disney testified before the House Un-\\nAmerican Activities Committee  (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell ,\\nDavid Hilberman  and William Pomerance , former animators and labor\\nunion  organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike\\nled by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence  in\\nHollywood.[169][170]\\nThe New York Times  reported in 1993  that Disney had been an FBI\\ninformant passing  secret information to J. Edgar Hoover about communist\\nactivities in Hollywood.[171] However, while Walt Disney was made a\\n\"Special Agent in Charge Contact\" in 1954, FBI officials claim this was\\nlargely an honorary title regularly awarded to members of a community\\nwho might be of use to the bureau.[172][173] The FBI declass ified and\\nreleased Walt Disney\\'s file on their website, and revealed that much of\\nDisney\\'s correspondence with the bureau (via studio personnel) was in\\nrelation to the production of educational films ; such as a certain installment\\nof the \"Career Day\" newsreel  segments  on The Mick ey Mouse Club  focusing\\non the bureau (which aired in Janu ary 1958), as well as an unmade 1961\\neducational short warning children about the dangers of child\\nmolestation .[172][174]\\nDisney\\'s public persona was very different from his actual personality.[175]\\nPlaywright Robert E. Sherwood  described him as \"almost painfully shy ...\\ndiffident\" and self-deprecating.[176] According to his biographer Richard\\nSchickel , Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public\\nidentity.[177] Kimball argues that Disney \"played the role of a bashful tycoon\\nwho was embarrassed in public\" and knew that he was doing so.[178] Disney\\nacknowledged the façade and told a friend that \"I\\'m not Walt Disney. I do a\\nlot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke . I\\nsmoke. Walt Disney does not drink . I drink.\"[179] Critic Otis Ferg uson , in\\nThe New  Republic , called the private  Disney: \"common and everyday, not\\nA portrait of Disney with\\ncartoon representations of\\ndifferent nationalities on a 6\\ncent U.S. postage stamp,\\n1968inaccessible, not in a foreign langu age, not suppressed or sponsored or\\nanything. Just Disney.\"[178] Many of those with whom Disney worked\\ncommented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his\\nexceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said\\n\"That\\'ll work\", it was an indication  of high praise.[180] Instead of direct\\napproval, Disney  gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or\\nrecommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would\\nbe passed on.[181]\\nViews of Disney and his work have changed\\nover the decade s, and there have been\\npolarized opinions.[182] Mark Langer, in the\\nAmerican Dictionary of National Biography ,\\nwrites that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney\\nhailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and\\npopularizer of culture. More recently, Disney\\nhas been regarded as a paradigm of American\\nimperialism  and intolerance, as well as a\\ndebaser of culture. \"[58] Stev en Watts wrot e that\\nsome denounce Disney \"as a cynical\\nmanipulator of cultural and commercial\\nformulas\",[182] while PBS  reco rds that critics\\nhave cens ured his work because of its \"smooth\\nfaçade of sentimentality and stubborn\\noptimism, its feel-good re-write of American\\nhistory\".[183]\\nDisney has been accused of anti-Semitism  for\\nhaving given Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl  a tour of his studio a\\nmonth after Kristallnacht .[184] Disney disavowed the tour three months\\nlater, saying he was unaware who she was when he received the\\ninvitation.[185] It has been suggested that Riefenst ahl\\'s visit was also likelyReputation\\nfinancially motivated as an attempt by Disney to recover more than 135,0 00\\nReichmarks  owed from his German film distributor and to get the ban on\\nDisney films lifted in Germany.[172][y] According to Disn ey biographer Neal\\nGabler, Disney was apolitical  and \"som ething of a political naïf\" during the\\n1930s and he had previously told one reporter – as tensions in Europe were\\nbrewing – that America should \"let \\'em fight their own wars\" claiming  he\\nhad \"learned my lesson\" from World War I.[188][z] During World War II,\\nDisney was actively involved in maki ng propaganda films against the Nazis,\\nboth for the general public (such as Der Fuehrer\\'s Face  and Education for\\nDeath ), as well as educa tional and training films exclusively for the United\\nStates Government . As early as March 1941 (sever al months before\\nAmerica\\'s entry into the war) Disney began offering his services to various\\nbranches of the United States Armed Forces  to make training films \"...for\\nnational defence industries at cost and without profit. In making this offer,\\nI am motivated solely by a desire to help as best I can in the present\\nemergency.\"[190] Since many of these training films contained highly\\nclassified informat ion and required the highest level of security clearance  to\\nbe viewed, if Disn ey had any previous sympathies towards Nazi Germa ny,\\nthe U.S. Governme nt would have likely disqualified him from making these\\nfilms.[172]\\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum  acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes\\ncommon to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons[aa] but\\nalso points out that Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities and was\\nnamed the 1955 \"Man of the Year\" by the B\\'nai B\\'rith chapter in Beverly\\nHills.[191][192] the organization itself found no evidence of anti-Semitism on\\nDisney\\'s part. The plaque read: \"For exemplifying the best tenets of\\nAmerican citizensh ip and inter-group understanding and interpreting into\\naction the ideals of B\\'nai B\\'rith. \"[172] Disney had numerous Jewish\\nemployees, many  of whom were in influential positions.[193] Non e of\\nDisney\\'s employees including animator Art Babbitt , who disliked Disney\\nintensely – ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.[187]\\nJewish story man Joe Grant , who worked closely with Disney throughout\\nthe 1930s  and 1940s stated, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, there was no evidence\\nof anti-Semitism. I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried\\ndeep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the\\nstudio were Jewish. It\\'s much ado about nothing. I never once had a\\nproblem with him in that way.\"[172][ab] In addition songwriter Robert B.\\nSherman  recalled that when one of Disney\\'s lawyers made anti-Semitic\\nremarks towards him and his brother Richard , Disney defended them and\\nfired the attorney.[194][172] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted\\naccess to the Disney archives, conc ludes that the available evidence does\\nnot support accusations of anti-Sem itism and that Disney largely got that\\nreputation due to his association with Motion Picture Alliance for the\\nPreservation of American Ideals  – an anti-Communist organization formed\\nin 1944, that was rumored to have anti-Semitic undertones. Gabler\\nconcludes that \"...though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-\\nSemitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-\\nSemitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expung e it\\nthroughout his life.\"[195] Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture\\nAlliance, and had no involvement with the organization after 1947.[196]\\nAccording to Disney\\'s daughter Diane Disney-Miller , her sister Sharon\\ndated a Jewish boyfriend for a perio d of time, to which her father raised no\\nobjections and even reportedly said, \"Sharon, I think it\\'s wonderful how\\nthese Jewish families have accepted you.\"[172]\\nDisney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his\\nproductions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially\\ninsensitive material.[197][ac] Gabler argues that \"Walt Disney was no racist.\\nHe never, either publicly or privat ely, made disparaging remarks about\\nblacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his\\ngeneration, however, he was racially insensitive.\"[197] The feature film Song\\nof the South  was criticized by contemporary film critics, the NAACP , and\\nothers for its perpetuation of black stereotypes ,[198] but during filming\\nDisney became close friends with its star, James Baskett , describing him in\\na letter to his sister Ruth as \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered  in\\nyears.\"[199] Disney and Baskett stayed in contact long after the film\\'s\\nproduction, with Walt even sending him gifts. When Baskett was in failing\\nhealth, Disney not only began financially supporting him and his family, but\\nalso campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academ y Award  for his\\nperformance, making Baskett the first black actor so honored.[199] Baskett\\ndied shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for\\nhis support claiming he had been a \"friend in deed and [we] certainly have\\nbeen in need.\"[200][172] Floyd Norman , the studio\\'s first black animator who\\nworked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did\\nI observe  a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused  of\\nafter his death. His treatment of people — and by this I mean all people — can\\nonly be called exemplary.\"[201]\\nWatts argues that many of Disney\\'s  post-World War II films \"legislated a\\nkind of cultural Marshall Plan . They nourished a genial cultural imperialis m\\nthat mag ically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectatio ns,\\nand goods of a prosperous middle-c lass United States.\"[202] Film  historian\\nJay P. Telotte  ackn owledges that many see Disney\\'s studio as an \"agent of\\nmanipulation and repression\", although he observes that it has \"labo red\\nthroughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and\\nfantasy\".[203] John Tomlinson, in his study Cultural Imperialism , examines\\nthe work of Ariel Dorfman  and Armand Mattelart , whose 1971 book Para\\nleer al Pato Donald  (transl.  How to Read Donald Duck ) identifies that\\nthere are \"imperia list ... values \\'conc ealed\\' behind the innocent, wholesome\\nfaçade of the world of Walt Disney\"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"it\\npresents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.\"[204]\\nTomlinson views their argument as flawed, as \"they simply assume  that\\nreading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the\\naffluent ... [\\' Yankee \\'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".[205]\\nDisney has been portrayed numerou s times in fictional works. H. G. Wells\\nreferences Disney in his 1938 novel The Holy Terror , in which World\\nDictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator.[206]\\nDisney was portray ed by Len Cariou  in the 1995 made- for-TV film A Dream\\nIs a Wish  Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story ,[207] and by Tom\\nHanks  in the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks .[208] In 2001, the Germ an author\\nPeter Step han Jungk publishe d Der Köni g von Amerika  (trans: The King  of\\nAmerica ), a fiction al work of Disney\\'s later years that re-imagines him as a\\npower-hungry racist. The composer Philip Glass  later adapted the book into\\nthe opera The Perfect American  (2013).[209]\\nSeveral commentators have described Disney as a cultural icon.[210] On\\nDisney\\'s death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the\\nvalues in Disney\\'s films are thos e \"considered valuable in American\\nChristian society\", which include \"individualism, decency, ... love for our\\nfellow man, fair play and toleration\".[211] Disney\\'s obituary in The Times\\ncalls the films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining ... of\\nincomparable artistry and of touching beauty\".[212] Journalist Bosley\\nCrowther  argu es that Disne y\\'s \"achievement as a creator of entertainment\\nfor an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of\\nhis wares  can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists  in\\nhistory.\"[5] Correspo ndent Alistair Cooke  calls Disney a \"folk-hero ... the\\nPied Piper of Holly wood\",[213] while Gabler cons iders Disney \"reshaped the\\nculture and the American consciousness\".[214] In the American Dictionary\\nof National Biography , Langer writes:\\nDisney remains the central figure in the history of animation.\\nThrough technological innovations and alliances with\\ngovernments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio\\nin a marginal form of communication into a multinational\\nleisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern,\\ncorporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values\\nhas possibly gained greater curren cy in the years after his\\ndeath.[58]\\nDisney in 1953, winning the\\nAcademy Award for Best\\nLive Action Short Film for\\nWater Birds (1952)In December 2021, the Metropolitan Mus eum of Art in New York open ed a\\nthree-month spec ial exhibit in honor of Disney titled \"Inspiring Walt\\nDisney\".[215]\\nDisney received 59 Academy Award\\nnominations, inclu ding 22 awards: both totals\\nare records.[216] He was nominated for three\\nGolden Globe Awards , but did not win, but he\\nwas pres ented with two Special Achievement\\nAwards — for Bambi  (1942) and The Living\\nDesert  (1953) — and the Cecil B. DeMille\\nAward .[217] He also received four Emmy Award\\nnominations, winn ing once, for Best Producer\\nfor the Disneyland  television series.[218]\\nSeveral of his films are included in the United\\nStates National Film Registry  by the Library of\\nCongress  as \"culturally, historically, or\\naesthetically significant\": Steamboat Willie ,\\nThe Three Little Pigs , Snow White and the\\nSeven Dwarfs , Fantasia , Pinocchio , Bambi ,\\nDumbo  and Mary Poppins .[219] In 1998, the\\nAmerican Film Institute  publishe d a list of the 100 greatest American films,\\naccording to industry experts; the list included Snow White and the Seven\\nDwarfs  (at number 49), and Fantasia  (at 58).[220]\\nIn February 1960, Disney was indu cted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame\\nwith two stars, one for motion pictures and the other for his television\\nwork;[221] Mickey Mouse was given his own  star for motion pictures in\\n1978, and Disneyland received one in 2005.[222][223] Disney was also\\ninducted into the Television Hall of Fame  in 1986,[224] the California HallAwards and honors\\nof Fame  in December 2006,[225] was the inaugural recipient of a star on the\\nAnaheim walk of stars in 2014,[226] and was a member of the first Orange\\nCounty Hall of Fame  class in 2023.[227]\\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum records that he \"along with members of\\nhis staff, received more than 950 honors and citations from throughout the\\nworld\".[19] He was made a Chevalier  in the French Légion d\\'honneur  in\\n1935,[228] and in 1952 he was awarded the country\\'s highest artistic\\ndecoration, the Officer d\\'Academie .[229] Other national awards include\\nThailand\\'s Order of the Crown  (1960); Germany\\'s Order of Merit\\n(1956),[230] Brazil\\'s Order of the Southern Cross  (1941),[231] and Mexico\\'s\\nOrder of the Aztec Eagle  (1943).[232] In the United States, he received the\\nPresidential Meda l of Freedom  on September 14, 1964,[233] and on May 24,\\n1968, he was posth umously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal .[234] He\\nreceived the Showman of the World Award from the National Association of\\nTheatre Owners,[232] and in 1955, the National Audubon  Society  awarded\\nDisney its highest honor, the Audubon Medal, for promoting the\\n\"appreciation and understanding of nature\" through his True-Life\\nAdventures  nature films.[235] A minor planet  discovered in 1980 by\\nastronomer Lyudmila Karachkina , was named 4017 Disneya ,[236] and he\\nwas also awarded honorary degrees  from Harvard , Yale , the University of\\nSouthern California  and the University of California, Los Angeles .[19]\\na. 22 competitive, 4 honorary\\nb.

Disney was a descendant of Robert d\\'Isigny , a Frenchman who had\\ntraveled to England with William the Conqueror  in 1066.[6] The family\\nanglicized  the d\\'Isigny name to \"Disney\" and settled in the English\\nvillage now known as Norton Disney  in the East Midlands .[7]\\nd. The book, Edwin G.

In 2006, the W alt Disney Company  finally re-acquired Oswald the Lucky\\nRabbit when its subsidiary ESPN  purchased rights to the character ,\\nalong with other properties from NBCUniversal .[51]\\ng. Several stories about the origins exist. Disney\\'s biographer , Bob\\nThomas , observes that \"The birth of Mickey Mouse is obscured in\\nlegend, much of it created by W alt Disney himself.\"[52]\\nh. The name Mortimer Mouse was used in the 1936 cartoon Mickey\\'s\\nRival  as a potential love-interest for Minnie Mouse . He was portrayed as\\na \"humorous denigration of the smooth city slicker\" with a smart car , but\\nfailed to win over Minnie from the more homespun Mickey .[54]\\ni. By 1931 he was called Michael Maus in Germany , Michel Souris in\\nFrance, Miguel Ratonocito or Miguel Pericote in Spain and Miki Kuchi in\\nJapan.[63]\\nj. $1.5 million in 1937 equates to $31,791,667 in 2024; $6.5 million in\\n1939 equates to $142,719,424 in 2024, according to calculations based\\non the Consumer Price Index  measure of inflation.[82]\\nk. The citation for the award reads: \"T o Walt Disney for Snow White and\\nthe Seven Dwarfs, recognized as a significant screen innovation which\\nhas charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field for\\nthe motion picture cartoon.\"[83]\\nl. The trip inspired two combined live-action and animation works Saludos\\nAmigos  (1942) and The Three Caballeros  (1945).[89][90]\\nm. $4 million in 1944 equates to $69,232,514 in 2024, according to\\ncalculations based on the Consumer Price Index  measure of\\ninflation.[82]\\nn.

The Nine Old Men  consisted of Eric Larson , Wolfgang Reitherman , Les\\nClark , Milt Kahl , Ward Kimball , Marc Davis , Ollie Johnston , Frank\\nThomas  and John Lounsbery .[58]\\nr. Even repeats of the program proved more popular than all other\\ntelevision shows—aside from Lucille Ball \\'s I Love Lucy ; no ABC\\nprogram had ever been in the top 25 before Disneyland .[117]\\ns. The program, which was produced by Ward Kimball , was nominated for\\nan Academy Award for the Best Documentary (Short Subject)  at the\\n1957 Awards .[126]\\nt. Disney\\'s death in 1966, and opposition from conservationists, stopped\\nthe building of the resort.[135]\\nu. A long-standing urban legend  maintains that Disney was cryonically\\nfrozen .[145] Disney\\'s daughter Diane later stated, \"There is absolutely no\\ntruth to the rumor that my father , Walt Disney , wished to be\\nfrozen.\"[146][147]\\nv. Roy died two months later , in December 1971.[153]\\nw. One possible exception to the stable relationship was during the making\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs  (1937), where the stresses and\\nturmoil associated with the production led to the couple discussing\\ndivorce.[159]\\nx. Lillian had two miscarriages during the eight years between marriage\\nand the birth of Diane; she suf fered a further miscarriage shortly before\\nthe family adopted Sharon.[161]\\ny. Another example included animator Art Babbitt , organizer behind the\\n1941 strike at the studio and who held a well-known grudge against\\nDisney . Babbitt claimed in his later years that he saw Disney and his\\nlawyer attend meetings of the German American Bund , a pro-Nazi\\norganization, during the late 1930s.[186] However according to Gabler:\\n\"...that was highly unlikely , not only because W alt had little enough time\\nfor his family , much less political meetings, but because he had no real\\npolitical leanings at the time.\"[187] Disney\\'s of fice appointment book\\nmakes no mention of him attending Bund rallies, and no other\\nanimators ever made claims of Disney attending such meetings.[172]\\nz. Disney also demonstrated his political naivete in an October 1933 issue\\nof Overland Monthly  claiming: \"...there must be millions of people who\\nhave a downright feeling of animosity for our M. Mouse. Mr . A. Hitler ,\\nthe Nazi old thing, says that Mickey\\'s silly . Imagine that! W ell, Mickey is\\ngoing to save Mr . A Hitler from drowning or something some day . Just\\nwait and see if he doesn\\'t. Then won\\'t Mr . A. Hitler be\\nashamed!\"[172][189]\\naa. Examples include The Three Little Pigs  (in which the Big Bad W olf\\ncomes to the door dressed as a Jewish peddler) and The Opry House\\n(in which Mickey Mouse is dressed and dances as a Hasidic\\nJew).[191][192]\\nab. Other Jewish employees production manager Harry Tytle, and head of\\nmerchandising Kay Kamen , who once quipped that Disney\\'s New York\\noffice had \"more Jews than The Book of Leviticus\"[193]\\nac. Examples include Mickey\\'s Mellerdrammer , in which Mickey Mouse\\ndresses in blackface ; the black-colored bird in the short Who Killed\\nCock Robin ; the American Indians in Peter Pan ; and the crows in\\nDumbo  (although the case has been made that the crows were\\nsympathetic to Dumbo because they knew what it was like to be\\nostracized).[197]\\n1. \"Disney to Quit Post at Studio\"  (https://www .newspapers.com/image/38\\n0710879/) .

As a film producer, he\\nholds the record for most Academy\\nAwards  earned and nominations by\\nan individ ual.

Several\\nof his films are included in the\\nNational Film Registry  by the\\nLibrary of Congress  and have also\\nbeen nam ed as some of the greatest\\nfilms ever  by the American Film\\nInstitute .\\nBorn in Chicago in 1901, Disney\\ndeveloped an early interest in\\ndrawing.

With Ub\\nIwerks , he developed the character\\nMickey Mouse  in 1928 , his first\\nhighly popular success; he also\\nprovided the voice for his creation in\\nthe early  years. As the studio grew ,\\nhe became more adventurous,\\nintroducing synchronized sound ,\\nfull-color three-strip Technicolor ,\\nfeature-length  cartoons and\\ntechnical developm ents in cameras.\\nThe resul ts, seen in features such as\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\n(1937), Pinocchio , Fantasia  (both\\n1940), Dumbo  (1941), and Bambi\\n(1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and\\nlive-action films  followed  after World War II, including the critically\\nsuccessful Cinderella  (1950), Sleeping Beauty  (1959) and Mary Poppins\\n(1964), the last of which received five Academy Awards.\\nIn the 1950s, Disn ey expanded into the amusement park  industry, and in\\nJuly 1955 he opened Disneyland  in Anaheim, California . To fund the proje ct\\nhe diversified into television programs, such as Walt Disney\\'s Disneyland\\nand The Mick ey Mous e Club . He was also involved in planning the 1959\\nMoscow Fair, the 1960 Win ter Olympics , and the 1964 New  York World\\'s\\nFair. In 1965,  he began development of another theme park, Disney World ,\\nthe heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"Experimental Prototype\\nCommunity of Tomorrow \" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker\\nthroughout his life and died of lung cancer in 1966 before either the park or\\nthe EPCOT project were completed.\\nDisney\\'s childhood homeDisney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted\\na warm and outg oing public persona. He had high standards and high\\nexpectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been\\naccusations that he was racist  or antisemitic , they have been contradicted\\nby many who knew him. Historiography of Disney has taken a variety of\\nperspectives, rang ing from views of him as a purveyor of homely patriotic\\nvalues  to being a repres entative of American cultural imperialism . Wid ely\\nconsidered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th\\ncentury, Disney remains an important presence in the history of animation\\nand in the cultural history of the United States , where he is acknowledged\\nas a national cultural icon . His film work continues to be shown and\\nadapted, the Disney theme parks have grown in size and number to attract\\nvisitors in several countries and his company has grown to become one of\\nthe world\\'s largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates .\\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901,\\nat 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago\\'s\\nHermosa  neighborhood.[b] He was the\\nfourth son of Elias Disney — born in the\\nProvince of Canada , to Irish  parents — \\nand Flora (née Call), an Americ an of\\nGerman and English descent.[4][5][c]\\nAside from Walt, Elias and Flora\\'s sons\\nwere Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and\\nthe couple had a fifth child, Ruth , in\\nDecember 1903.[8] In 1906, when\\nDisney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missou ri, where\\nhis uncle  Robert had just purchased  land. In Marceline, Disney developed\\nhis interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired\\nneighborhood doctor.[9] Elias was a subs criber to the Appeal to Reason\\nnewspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-pageEarly life\\ncartoons of Ryan Walker.[10] He also began to develop an abilit y to work\\nwith watercolors and crayons.[5] He lived  near the Atchison, Topeka and\\nSanta Fe Railway  line and became enamored with trains.[11] He and his\\nyounger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School  in\\nMarceline in late 1909.[12] The Disney fami ly were active members of a\\nCongregational church .[13]\\nIn 1911, the Disn eys moved to Kansas City, Missouri .[14] There, Disney\\nattended the Benton Grammar School , where he met fellow-student Walte r\\nPfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the\\nworld of vaudeville  and motion pictures. Before long, Disney was spending\\nmore time at the Pfeiffers\\' house than at home.[15] Elias had purchased a\\nnewspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star  and Kansas City Times .\\nDisney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the\\nTimes  before school and repeated the round for the evening Star  after\\nschool. The schedule was exhausting , and Disney often received poor grades\\nafter falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than\\nsix years.[16] He atten ded Satu rday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute\\nand also took a correspondence course  in cartooning.[5][17]\\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company,\\nand moved back to the city with his family.[18] Disn ey enrolled at McKinley\\nHigh School  and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing\\npatriotic pictures about World War I;[19][20] he also took night courses at\\nthe Chicago Academy of Fine Arts .[21] In mid-1918, he attempted to join the\\nUnited States Army  to fight the Germans , but he was rejected as too young.\\nAfter forging the date of birth  on his birth certificate, he joined the Red\\nCross  in Septem ber 1918  as an ambulance  driver. He was shipped to France\\nbut arrive d in November, after the armis tice.[22] He drew cartoons on the\\nside of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in\\nthe army  newspaper Stars and Stripes .[23] He returned to Kansas City in\\nOctober 1919,[24] where he worked  as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-\\nWalt Disney\\'s business envelope\\nfeatured a self-portrait, c.\\u20091921.Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for\\nadvertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub\\nIwerks .[25]\\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin\\'s\\nrevenue declined  after Christmas,\\nDisney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid\\noff. They started their own business, the\\nshort-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial\\nArtists.[26] Failing to attract many\\ncustomers, Disney and Iwerks agreed\\nthat Disney should leave temporaril y to\\nearn money at the Kansas City Film Ad\\nCompany, run by A. V. Cauger; the\\nfollowing month Iwerks, who was not\\nable to run their business alone, also joined.[27] The company produced\\ncommercials using the cutout animation  technique.[28] Disney became\\ninterested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt\\nand Jeff and Max Fleischer \\'s Out of the Inkwell . With the assistance of a\\nborrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at\\nhome.[29][d] He came to the conclusion that cel anim ation  was more\\npromising than the cutout method.[e] Unable to persuad e Cauger to try cel\\nanimation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-wor ker\\nfrom the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman .[31] Their main client was the local\\nNewman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as\\n\"Newman\\'s Laugh -O-Grams\".[32] Disney studied Paul Terry\\'s  Aesop\\'s\\nFables  as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized\\nfairy tales.[33]Career\\nEarly career: 1920–1928\\nIn May 1921, the success of the \"Lau gh-O-Grams\" led to the establishment\\nof Laugh-O-Gram Studio , for which he hired more animators, including\\nFred Harman\\'s brother Hugh , Rudolf Ising  and Iwerks.[34] The Laugh-O-\\nGrams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the compa ny\\nsolvent, so Disney started production of Alice\\'s Wonderland  — based on\\nAlice\\'s Adventures in Wonderlan d — which combined live action with\\nanimation; he cast Virginia Davis  in the title role.[35] The result, a 12½-\\nminute, one-reel  film, was compl eted too late to save Laugh-O-Gram\\nStudio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.[36]\\nDisney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New\\nYork was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles\\nbecause his brothe r Roy was conval escing from tuberculosis  there,[37] and\\nhe hoped  to become a live-action film director.[38] Disney\\'s  efforts to sell\\nAlice\\'s Wonderland  were in vain until he heard from  New York film\\ndistributor Margaret J. Winkler . She was losing the rights to both the Out of\\nthe Inkwell  and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In\\nOctober, they signed a contract for six Alice  comedies , with an option for\\ntwo further series of six episodes each.[38][39] Disney and his brother Roy\\nformed the Disney Brothers Studio — which later became The Walt  Disney\\nCompany — to produce the films;[40][41] they persuaded Davis and her\\nfamily to relocate to Hollywood  to conti nue prod uction, with Davis on\\ncontract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwer ks,\\npersuading him to relocate to Hollyw ood from Kansas City.[42] In 1926,[43]\\nthe first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyper ion\\nAvenue; the building was demolished in 1940.[44]\\nBy 1926,  Winkler \\'s role in the distribution of the Alice  series had been\\nhanded over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although  the\\nrelationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.[45] The\\nseries ran until July 1927,[46] by which time Disney had begun to tire of it\\nand want ed to move away from the mixed format to all animation.[45][47]\\nAfter Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal\\nPictures , Disney and Iwer ks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , a character\\nDisney wanted to be \"peppy, alert,  saucy and venturesome, keeping him\\nalso neat and trim\".[47][48]\\nIn February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the\\nOswald  series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had\\nalso persuaded many of the artist s involved to work directly for him,\\nincluding Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell  and Friz Freleng . Disney also\\nfound out that Universal owned the intellectual proper ty rights  to Oswald.\\nMintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if\\nDisney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz\\'s ultimat um\\nand lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain\\nwith him.[49][50][f]\\nTo replac e Oswald , Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse , possibly\\ninspired by a pet mouse that Disn ey had adopted while working in his\\nLaugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are\\nunclear.[52][g] Disney\\'s  original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but\\nhis wife Lillian  thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey\\ninstead.[53][h] Iwerks revised Disney\\'s provisional sketches to make the\\ncharacter easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself\\nfrom the animatio n process,[55] provided  Mickey\\'s voice until 1947.  In the\\nwords of one Disn ey employee, \"Ub designed Mickey\\'s physical appearan ce,\\nbut Walt gave him his soul.\"[56]\\nMickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the\\nshort Plane Crazy , but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin\\' Gaucho ,\\nfailed to find a distributor.[57] Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz\\nSinger , Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat\\nWillie , to create the first post-produced sound cartoon . After the animationCreation of Mickey Mouse and following successes: 1928–\\n1934\\nThe first appearance of Mickey\\nMouse, in Steamboat Willie (1928)was complete, Disney signed a cont ract\\nwith the former executive of Universal\\nPictures, Pat Powers , to use the \"Powers\\nCinephone\" recording system;[58]\\nCinephone became the new distributor\\nfor Disney\\'s early sound cartoons, which\\nsoon became popular.[59]\\nTo improve the quality of the music,\\nDisney hired the professional composer\\nand arra nger Carl Stalling, on whose\\nsuggestion the Silly Symphony  series\\nwas developed, providing stories\\nthrough the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance  (1929),\\nwas drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were\\nseveral artists, both local and from New York.[60] Both the Mickey Mouse\\nand Silly Sym phonies  series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt\\nthey were  not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930,\\nDisney tried to trim  costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the\\npractice of drawing every frame individually in favor of the more effici ent\\ntechnique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the inbetween\\nposes . Disney asked Powers for an increa se in payments for the cartoons.\\nPowers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly\\nafterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.[61]\\nDisney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931 — which he blamed on the\\nmachinations of Powers and his own overwork — so he and Lillian took an\\nextended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.[62]\\nWith the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with\\nColumbia Pictures  to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became\\nincreasingly popu lar, including internationally.[63][64][i] Disney and his\\ncrew also introduc ed new cartoon stars like Pluto  in 1930, Goofy  in 1932\\nand Donald Duck in 1934.[65] Always keen to embrace new technology and\\nencouraged by his new contract with  United Artists , Disney filmed Flowers\\n7:47CC\\nand Tree s (1932) in full-colo r three-strip Technicolor ;[66] he was also able\\nto negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process\\nuntil August 31, 1935.[67] All subsequent Silly Sym phony  cartoons  were in\\ncolor.[68] Flowers and Trees  was popular with audiences[69] and won the\\ninaugural Academy Award  for best Short Subject (Cartoon)  at the 1932\\nceremony . Disney had been nominated for another film in that category,\\nMickey\\'s Orphans , and received an Honorary Award  \"for the creation of\\nMickey Mouse\".[70][71]\\nIn 1933, Disney produced The Thre e Little Pigs , a film described by the\\nmedia historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all\\ntime\".[72] The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short\\nSubject (Cartoon) category. The film\\'s success led to a further increase in\\nthe studi o\\'s staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year.[73]\\nDisney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that\\nwould interest the audience,[74] and he invested in a \"story depart ment\"\\nseparate from the animators, with storyboard artists  who would detail the\\nplots of Disney\\'s films.[75]\\nBy 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing cartoon shorts,[65]\\nand belie ved a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable.[76] The\\nstudio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven\\nDwarfs , based on the fairy tale. When news leak ed out about the project,\\nmany in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company;\\nindustry insiders nicknamed it \"Disn ey\\'s Folly\".[77] The film, which was the\\nfirst anim ated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to\\nproduce — three times over budget.[78] To ensure the animation was as\\nrealistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard\\nArt Institute ;[79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that\\nthe anima tors could study realistic movement.[80] To portray the changing\\nperspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disne y\\'sGolden age of animation: 1934–1941\\nWalt Disney introduces each of the\\nseven dwarfs in a scene from the\\noriginal 1937 Snow White theatrical\\ntrailer.animators developed a multiplane\\ncamera  which allowed drawings on\\npieces of glass to be set at various\\ndistances from the camera, creating an\\nillusion of depth. The glass could be\\nmoved to create the impression of a\\ncamera passing through the scene. The\\nfirst work created on the camera — a\\nSilly Symphony  called The Old Mill\\n(1937) — won the Academy Award for\\nAnimated Short Film because of its\\nimpressive visual power. Although\\nSnow White  had been largely finished\\nby the time the multiplane camera had\\nbeen completed, Disney ordered som e scenes be re-drawn to use the new\\neffects.[81]\\nSnow White  premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and\\naudiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and\\nby May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful\\nsound film made to that date.[77][j] Disney won anoth er Honorary Academy\\nAward, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar\\nstatuettes.[83][k] The success of Snow White heralded  one of the most\\nproductive eras for the studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum  calls the\\nfollowing years \"the \\'Golden Age of Animation\\' \".[84][85] With work on Snow\\nWhite  finished, the studio began producing Pinocchio  in early 1938 and\\nFantasia  in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940,\\nand neither performed well at the box office — partly because revenues from\\nEurope had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio\\nincurred a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of\\nFebruary 1941.[86]\\nDisney drawing Goofy for a\\ngroup of girls in Argentina,\\n1941In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the\\ncompany\\'s first public stock offering  in 1940, and impl emented heavy salary\\ncuts. The latter measure, and Disney\\'s sometimes high-handed and\\ninsensitive manne r of dealing with  staff, led to a 1941 animators\\' strike\\nwhich lasted five weeks.[87] While a federal mediator from the National\\nLabor Relations Board  negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an\\noffer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs  to make a\\ngoodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolut ion\\nhe knew would be unfavorable to the studio.[88][l] Due to the strike — and\\nthe financial state of the company — several animators left the studio, and\\nDisney\\'s relationsh ip with other members of staff was permanently strained\\nas a result.[91] The strike temporarily interrupted the studio\\'s next\\nproduction, Dumbo  (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and\\ninexpensive mann er; the film receiv ed a positive reaction from audien ces\\nand critics alike.[92]\\nShortly after the release of Dumbo  in October\\n1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney\\nformed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit\\nwithin the company to produce instruction\\nfilms for the military such as Four Methods of\\nFlush Riveting  and Aircraft Production\\nMethods .[93] Disney also met with Henry\\nMorgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury ,\\nand agreed to produce short Donald Duck\\ncartoons to promote war bonds .[94] Disney also\\nproduced several  propaganda prod uctions ,\\nincluding shorts such as Der Fueh rer\\'s Face — \\nwhich won an Academy Award — and the 1943\\nfeature film Victory Through Air Power .[95]World War II and beyond: 1941–1950\\nThe milit ary films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the\\nfeature film Bambi  — which had been in production since 1937 — \\nunderperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box\\noffice.[96] On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio  and Fantasia , the\\ncompany had debts of $4 million with the Bank of America  in 1944.[97][m]\\nAt a mee ting with  Bank of America  executives to discuss the future of the\\ncompany, the bank\\'s chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini , told his\\nexecutives, \"I\\'ve been watching the Disneys\\' pictures quite closely because I\\nknew we were lending them money far above the financial risk. ... They\\'re\\ngood this year, they\\'re good next year, and they\\'re good the year after. ...\\nYou have  to relax and give them time to market their product.\"[98] Disney\\'s\\nproduction of short films decrease d in the late 1940s, coinciding with\\nincreasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros.  and\\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer . Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more\\ncombined animat ion and live-action productions.[58][n] In 1948, Disney\\ninitiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life\\nAdventures , with  Seal Islan d the first;  the film won the Academy  Award in\\nthe Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)  category.[99]\\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella , his studio\\'s first animated\\nfeature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audienc es.\\nCosting $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first\\nyear.[100][o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous\\npictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature,\\nTreasure Island  (1950), which was shot in Britain , as was The Stor y of\\nRobin Hood and His Merrie Men  (1952).[101] Other all-live-action features\\nfollowed, many of which had patriotic themes.[58][p] He continued to\\nproduce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland\\n(1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to\\ndevote less attention to the animati on department, entrusting most of its\\noperations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men ,[q] although  he wasTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\\nDisney shows the plans of\\nDisneyland to officials from Orange\\nCounty in December 1954always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other\\nventures.[102] Around the sam e time, Disney established his own film\\ndistribution division Buena Vista , replacing his most recent distributor\\nRKO Pictures .[103]\\nFor several years Disney had been\\nconsidering building a theme park.\\nWhen he visited Griffith Park  in Los\\nAngeles with his daughters, he wan ted\\nto be in a clean, unspoiled park, where\\nboth children and their parents could\\nhave fun.[104] He visited the Tivoli\\nGardens  in Copenhagen, Denmark, and\\nwas heavily influenced by the\\ncleanliness and layout of the park.[105]\\nIn March 1952, he received zoning\\npermission to build a theme park in\\nBurbank, near the Disney studios.[106]\\nThis site proved too small, and a larger\\nplot in Anaheim , 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased. To\\ndistance the project from the studio  — which might attract the criticism of\\nshareholders — Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney\\nImagineering ) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and\\nanimators to work on the plans;[107][108] those involved became known as\\n\"Imagineers\".[109] After obtaining bank funding  he invited other\\nstockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres — part of\\nAmerican Broadc asting Company  (ABC) — and Western Printing  and\\nLithographing Company .[58] In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to\\nevery amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfa lls\\nor proble ms there were in the various locations and incorporated their\\nfindings into his design.[110] Construc tion work started in July 1954, and\\nDisneyland  opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on\\nABC, which reached 70 million viewers.[111] The park was designed as a\\nseries of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A. — a replica\\nof the main street in his hometown  of Marceline. The connected themed\\nareas were Adventureland , Frontierland , Fantasyland  and Tomorrowland .\\nThe park also contained the narrow gauge  Disneyland Railroad  that linked\\nthe lands ; around the outside of the park was a high berm  to separate the\\npark from the outside world.[112][113] An edito rial in The New York Times\\nconsidered that Disney had \"tastefully combined some of the pleas ant\\nthings of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow\".[114] Although\\nthere were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a\\nmonth\\'s operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by\\nthe end of its first year, it attracted 3.6 million guests.[115]\\nThe money from ABC was continge nt on Disney television programs.[116]\\nThe studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christm as\\nDay 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland . Roy believed the\\nprogram added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to\\nshareholders, he wrote that \"television can be a most powerful selling aid\\nfor us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise\\nthat we enter television when we do\".[58] In 1954, after the Disneyland\\nfunding had been agreed, ABC broadcast Walt Disney\\'s Disneyland , an\\nanthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other\\nmaterial from the studio\\'s library. The show was successful in terms of\\nratings and profits, earning an audi ence share of over 50%.[117][r] In April\\n1955, Newsweek  called the series an \"American institution\".[118] ABC was\\npleased with the ratings, leading to Disney\\'s first daily television program,\\nThe Mick ey Mouse Club , a variety show catering specifically to children.[119]\\nThe program was accompanied by merchandising through vario us\\ncompanies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring\\nbooks and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connec ted\\nto the show).[120] One of the segments of Disneyland  consisted of the five-\\npart miniseries  Davy Crockett  which, according to Disney biograp her Neal\\nGabler , \"became an overnight sensation\".[121] The show\\'s theme song, \"The\\nDisney in 1954Ballad of Davy Crockett \", became internationally popular, and ten million\\nrecords were sold.[122] As a result, Disney formed his own record\\nproduction and distribution entity, Disneyland Records .[123]\\nAs well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects\\naway from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 American National\\nExhibition  in Moscow; Disney Studios\\' contribution was America the\\nBeautiful , a 19-minute film in the 360-degre e Circarama theater  that was\\none of the most popular attractions.[58] The follo wing year he acted as the\\nchairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Win ter Olympics  in\\nSquaw Valley, California , where he designe d the opening, closing and medal\\nceremonies .[124] He was one of twelve investors in the Celebrity Sports\\nCenter , which opened in 1960 in Glendale, Colorad o; he and Roy bought\\nout the others in 1962, making the Disney company the sole owner.[125]\\nDespite the demands wrought by non-studio\\nprojects, Disney continued to work on film and\\ntelevision projects. In 1955, he was involved in\\n\"Man in Space \", an episode of the Disneyland\\nseries, which was made in collabor ation with\\nNASA  rocket designer Wernher von Braun .[s]\\nDisney also oversa w aspects of the full-length\\nfeatures Lady and the Tramp  (the first\\nanimated film in CinemaScope ) in 1955,\\nSleeping Beauty  (the first anima ted film in\\nTechnirama  70 mm film) in 1959, One\\nHundred and One Dalmatians  (the first\\nanimated feature film to use Xerox cels) in\\n1961, and The Sword in the Stone  in 1963.[127]\\nIn 1964, Disney produced Mary Poppins , based on the book series  by P. L.\\nTravers ; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the\\n1940s.[128] It becam e the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although\\nTravers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights.[129]\\nThe same  year he also became invo lved in plans to expand the California\\nInstitute of the Arts  (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw\\nup blueprints for a new building.[130]\\nDisney provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair, for\\nwhich he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo ,\\nwho plan ned a tribute to UNICEF , Disney developed It\\'s a Small World , a\\nboat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world;\\nGreat Moments with Mr. Lincoln  contained an animatronic Abraham\\nLincoln  giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress  promoted\\nthe importance of electricity; and Ford\\'s Magic Skyway portrayed the\\nprogress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibits — principally concepts\\nand technology — were re-installed in Disneyland, although It\\'s a Small\\nWorld is the ride that most closely resembles the original.[131][132]\\nDuring the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a ski resort  in\\nMineral King, a glacial  valley in California\\'s Sierra Nevada . He hired  experts\\nsuch as the reno wned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy\\nSchaeffler .[133] [134][t] With income from Disneyland accounting for an\\nincreasing proportion of the studio\\'s income, Disney continued to look for\\nvenues for other attractions. In 1963, he presented a project to creat e a\\ntheme park in downtown St. Louis , Missouri; he initially reached an\\nagreement with the Civic Center Redevelopment Corp, which controlled the\\nland, but the deal later collapsed over funding.[136][137] In late 1965, he\\nannounced plans to develop anoth er theme park to be called \"Disney\\nWorld\" (now Walt Disney World ), a few miles southwest of Orlando,\\nFlorida . Disney World was to include the \"Magic Kingdom\" — a larger and\\nmore elab orate version of Disneyland — plus golf courses and resort hotels.\\nThe hear t of Disney World was to be the \"Experimental Prototy pe\\nCommunity of Tomorrow\" ( EPCOT ),[138] which he described as:\\nan experimental prototype commu nity of tomorrow that will\\ntake its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are\\nnow emer ging from the creative centers of American industry. It\\nGrave of Walt Disney at\\nForest Lawn, Glendalewill be a commun ity of tomorrow that will never be completed,\\nbut will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating\\nnew materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a\\nshowcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of\\nAmerican free enterprise.[139]\\nDuring 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT.[140]\\nHe receiv ed a story credit in the 1966 film Lt. Robin  Crusoe, U.S.N.  as\\nRetlaw Yensid, his name spelt backw ards.[141] He incre ased his involvement\\nin the studio\\'s films, and was heavil y involved in the story development  of\\nThe Jungle Book , the live-action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire\\n(both 1967) and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\\n(1968).[142]\\nDisney had been a heavy smoker  since World\\nWar I. He did not use cigarettes with filters  and\\nhad smok ed a pipe as a young man. In early\\nNovember 1966, he was diagnosed  with lung\\ncancer  and was treated with cobalt therapy . On\\nNovember 30, he felt unwell and was taken by\\nambulance from his home to St. Joseph\\nHospital  where, on December 15, at age 65, he\\ndied of circulatory collap se caused by the\\ncancer.[143] His remains were cremated two\\ndays later and his ashes interred at the Forest\\nLawn Memorial Park  in Glendale,\\nCalifornia .[144][u]\\nThe release of The Jungle Book  and The Happiest Millionaire  in 1967\\nraised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to\\n81.[19] When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day  was released in 1968, itIllness, death and aftermath\\nExternal videos\\n Interview with Neal Gabler on\\nWalt Disney: The Triumph of the\\nAmerican Imagination, November\\n19, 2006 (https://www.c-span.org/vid\\neo/?195399-10/walt-disney), C-\\nSPANearned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category,\\nawarded posthumously.[148] After Disney\\'s death, his studios continued to\\nproduce live-action films prolificall y while the quality of their animated\\nfilms was allowed to languish. In the late 1980s, this trend was reversed in\\nwhat The New  York Times  describe s as the \"Disney Renaissance \" that\\nbegan with The Little Mermaid  (1989).[149] Disney\\'s studios continue to\\nproduce successful film, television and stage entertainment.[150]\\nDisney\\'s plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition.\\nAfter Disney\\'s death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full\\ncontrol of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a\\ntown to an attraction.[151] At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt\\nDisney World to his brother.[152][v] Walt Disney Wor ld expanded with the\\nopening of Epcot Center  in 1982;  Walt Disney\\'s vision of a functional city\\nwas replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world\\'s fair.[154] In 2009,\\nthe Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney\\'s daughter Diane and\\nher son Walter E. D. Miller, opened  in the Presidio of San Francisco .[155]\\nThousands of artifacts from Disney\\'s life and career are on display,\\nincluding numerous awards that he received.[156] In 2014, the Disne y theme\\nparks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.[157]\\nEarly in 1925, Disney hired an ink\\nartist, Lillian Bounds . They married in\\nJuly of that year, at her brothe r\\'s\\nhouse in her home town of Lewiston,\\nIdaho .[158] The marriage was generally\\nhappy, according to Lillian, although\\naccording to Disney\\'s biographer Neal\\nGabler  she did not \"accept Walt\\'s\\ndecisions meekly or his status\\nunquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people \\'howPersonal life and character\\nDisney family at Schiphol Airport\\n(1951)henpecked he is\\'.\"[159][w] Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood\\nsocial scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts,\\n\"content with household management and providing support for her\\nhusband\".[160] Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane  (born\\nDecember 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks\\npreviously).[161][x] Within the famil y, neither Disney nor his wife hid the\\nfact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people\\noutside the family raised the point.[162] The Disneys were  careful to keep\\ntheir daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the\\nlight of the Lindbergh kidnap ping ; Disney took steps to ensure his\\ndaughters were not photographed by the press.[163]\\nIn 1949, Disney and his family move d to\\na new home in the Holmby Hills  district\\nof Los Angeles. With the help of his\\nfriends Ward and Betty Kimball , who\\nalready had their own backyard\\nrailroad , Disney developed blueprints\\nand immediately set to work on creating\\na miniature live steam  railroad for his\\nback yard. The name of the railroad,\\nCarolwood Pacific Railroad , came from\\nhis home\\'s location on Carolwood Drive.\\nThe miniature working steam\\nlocomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie , and\\nDisney named it Lilly Belle after his wife;[164] after three years Disney\\nordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.[165]\\nDisney grew more politically conserv ative  as he got older. A Democratic\\nParty  supporter until the 1940 presidential election , when he switched\\nallegiance to the Republican Party ,[166] he beca me a generous donor to\\nThomas E. Dewey \\'s 1944 bid for the presidency .[167] In 1946, he was a\\nfounding member  of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of\\nAmerican Ideals , an orga nization who stated they \"believ[ed] in, and like,\\nthe Amer ican Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt agains t a\\nrising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by\\nsubversive means to undermine and change this way of life\".[168] In 1947,\\nduring the Second Red Scare , Disney testified before the House Un-\\nAmerican Activities Committee  (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell ,\\nDavid Hilberman  and William Pomerance , former animators and labor\\nunion  organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike\\nled by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence  in\\nHollywood.[169][170]\\nThe New York Times  reported in 1993  that Disney had been an FBI\\ninformant passing  secret information to J. Edgar Hoover about communist\\nactivities in Hollywood.[171] However, while Walt Disney was made a\\n\"Special Agent in Charge Contact\" in 1954, FBI officials claim this was\\nlargely an honorary title regularly awarded to members of a community\\nwho might be of use to the bureau.[172][173] The FBI declass ified and\\nreleased Walt Disney\\'s file on their website, and revealed that much of\\nDisney\\'s correspondence with the bureau (via studio personnel) was in\\nrelation to the production of educational films ; such as a certain installment\\nof the \"Career Day\" newsreel  segments  on The Mick ey Mouse Club  focusing\\non the bureau (which aired in Janu ary 1958), as well as an unmade 1961\\neducational short warning children about the dangers of child\\nmolestation .[172][174]\\nDisney\\'s public persona was very different from his actual personality.[175]\\nPlaywright Robert E. Sherwood  described him as \"almost painfully shy ...\\ndiffident\" and self-deprecating.[176] According to his biographer Richard\\nSchickel , Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public\\nidentity.[177] Kimball argues that Disney \"played the role of a bashful tycoon\\nwho was embarrassed in public\" and knew that he was doing so.[178] Disney\\nacknowledged the façade and told a friend that \"I\\'m not Walt Disney. I do a\\nlot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke . I\\nsmoke. Walt Disney does not drink . I drink.\"[179] Critic Otis Ferg uson , in\\nThe New  Republic , called the private  Disney: \"common and everyday, not\\nA portrait of Disney with\\ncartoon representations of\\ndifferent nationalities on a 6\\ncent U.S. postage stamp,\\n1968inaccessible, not in a foreign langu age, not suppressed or sponsored or\\nanything. Just Disney.\"[178] Many of those with whom Disney worked\\ncommented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his\\nexceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said\\n\"That\\'ll work\", it was an indication  of high praise.[180] Instead of direct\\napproval, Disney  gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or\\nrecommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would\\nbe passed on.[181]\\nViews of Disney and his work have changed\\nover the decade s, and there have been\\npolarized opinions.[182] Mark Langer, in the\\nAmerican Dictionary of National Biography ,\\nwrites that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney\\nhailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and\\npopularizer of culture. More recently, Disney\\nhas been regarded as a paradigm of American\\nimperialism  and intolerance, as well as a\\ndebaser of culture. \"[58] Stev en Watts wrot e that\\nsome denounce Disney \"as a cynical\\nmanipulator of cultural and commercial\\nformulas\",[182] while PBS  reco rds that critics\\nhave cens ured his work because of its \"smooth\\nfaçade of sentimentality and stubborn\\noptimism, its feel-good re-write of American\\nhistory\".[183]\\nDisney has been accused of anti-Semitism  for\\nhaving given Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl  a tour of his studio a\\nmonth after Kristallnacht .[184] Disney disavowed the tour three months\\nlater, saying he was unaware who she was when he received the\\ninvitation.[185] It has been suggested that Riefenst ahl\\'s visit was also likelyReputation\\nfinancially motivated as an attempt by Disney to recover more than 135,0 00\\nReichmarks  owed from his German film distributor and to get the ban on\\nDisney films lifted in Germany.[172][y] According to Disn ey biographer Neal\\nGabler, Disney was apolitical  and \"som ething of a political naïf\" during the\\n1930s and he had previously told one reporter – as tensions in Europe were\\nbrewing – that America should \"let \\'em fight their own wars\" claiming  he\\nhad \"learned my lesson\" from World War I.[188][z] During World War II,\\nDisney was actively involved in maki ng propaganda films against the Nazis,\\nboth for the general public (such as Der Fuehrer\\'s Face  and Education for\\nDeath ), as well as educa tional and training films exclusively for the United\\nStates Government . As early as March 1941 (sever al months before\\nAmerica\\'s entry into the war) Disney began offering his services to various\\nbranches of the United States Armed Forces  to make training films \"...for\\nnational defence industries at cost and without profit. In making this offer,\\nI am motivated solely by a desire to help as best I can in the present\\nemergency.\"[190] Since many of these training films contained highly\\nclassified informat ion and required the highest level of security clearance  to\\nbe viewed, if Disn ey had any previous sympathies towards Nazi Germa ny,\\nthe U.S. Governme nt would have likely disqualified him from making these\\nfilms.[172]\\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum  acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes\\ncommon to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons[aa] but\\nalso points out that Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities and was\\nnamed the 1955 \"Man of the Year\" by the B\\'nai B\\'rith chapter in Beverly\\nHills.[191][192] the organization itself found no evidence of anti-Semitism on\\nDisney\\'s part. The plaque read: \"For exemplifying the best tenets of\\nAmerican citizensh ip and inter-group understanding and interpreting into\\naction the ideals of B\\'nai B\\'rith. \"[172] Disney had numerous Jewish\\nemployees, many  of whom were in influential positions.[193] Non e of\\nDisney\\'s employees including animator Art Babbitt , who disliked Disney\\nintensely – ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.[187]\\nJewish story man Joe Grant , who worked closely with Disney throughout\\nthe 1930s  and 1940s stated, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, there was no evidence\\nof anti-Semitism. I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried\\ndeep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the\\nstudio were Jewish. It\\'s much ado about nothing. I never once had a\\nproblem with him in that way.\"[172][ab] In addition songwriter Robert B.\\nSherman  recalled that when one of Disney\\'s lawyers made anti-Semitic\\nremarks towards him and his brother Richard , Disney defended them and\\nfired the attorney.[194][172] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted\\naccess to the Disney archives, conc ludes that the available evidence does\\nnot support accusations of anti-Sem itism and that Disney largely got that\\nreputation due to his association with Motion Picture Alliance for the\\nPreservation of American Ideals  – an anti-Communist organization formed\\nin 1944, that was rumored to have anti-Semitic undertones. Gabler\\nconcludes that \"...though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-\\nSemitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-\\nSemitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expung e it\\nthroughout his life.\"[195] Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture\\nAlliance, and had no involvement with the organization after 1947.[196]\\nAccording to Disney\\'s daughter Diane Disney-Miller , her sister Sharon\\ndated a Jewish boyfriend for a perio d of time, to which her father raised no\\nobjections and even reportedly said, \"Sharon, I think it\\'s wonderful how\\nthese Jewish families have accepted you.\"[172]\\nDisney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his\\nproductions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially\\ninsensitive material.[197][ac] Gabler argues that \"Walt Disney was no racist.\\nHe never, either publicly or privat ely, made disparaging remarks about\\nblacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his\\ngeneration, however, he was racially insensitive.\"[197] The feature film Song\\nof the South  was criticized by contemporary film critics, the NAACP , and\\nothers for its perpetuation of black stereotypes ,[198] but during filming\\nDisney became close friends with its star, James Baskett , describing him in\\na letter to his sister Ruth as \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered  in\\nyears.\"[199] Disney and Baskett stayed in contact long after the film\\'s\\nproduction, with Walt even sending him gifts. When Baskett was in failing\\nhealth, Disney not only began financially supporting him and his family, but\\nalso campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academ y Award  for his\\nperformance, making Baskett the first black actor so honored.[199] Baskett\\ndied shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for\\nhis support claiming he had been a \"friend in deed and [we] certainly have\\nbeen in need.\"[200][172] Floyd Norman , the studio\\'s first black animator who\\nworked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did\\nI observe  a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused  of\\nafter his death. His treatment of people — and by this I mean all people — can\\nonly be called exemplary.\"[201]\\nWatts argues that many of Disney\\'s  post-World War II films \"legislated a\\nkind of cultural Marshall Plan . They nourished a genial cultural imperialis m\\nthat mag ically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectatio ns,\\nand goods of a prosperous middle-c lass United States.\"[202] Film  historian\\nJay P. Telotte  ackn owledges that many see Disney\\'s studio as an \"agent of\\nmanipulation and repression\", although he observes that it has \"labo red\\nthroughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and\\nfantasy\".[203] John Tomlinson, in his study Cultural Imperialism , examines\\nthe work of Ariel Dorfman  and Armand Mattelart , whose 1971 book Para\\nleer al Pato Donald  (transl.  How to Read Donald Duck ) identifies that\\nthere are \"imperia list ... values \\'conc ealed\\' behind the innocent, wholesome\\nfaçade of the world of Walt Disney\"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"it\\npresents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.\"[204]\\nTomlinson views their argument as flawed, as \"they simply assume  that\\nreading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the\\naffluent ... [\\' Yankee \\'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".[205]\\nDisney has been portrayed numerou s times in fictional works. H. G. Wells\\nreferences Disney in his 1938 novel The Holy Terror , in which World\\nDictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator.[206]\\nDisney was portray ed by Len Cariou  in the 1995 made- for-TV film A Dream\\nIs a Wish  Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story ,[207] and by Tom\\nHanks  in the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks .[208] In 2001, the Germ an author\\nPeter Step han Jungk publishe d Der Köni g von Amerika  (trans: The King  of\\nAmerica ), a fiction al work of Disney\\'s later years that re-imagines him as a\\npower-hungry racist. The composer Philip Glass  later adapted the book into\\nthe opera The Perfect American  (2013).[209]\\nSeveral commentators have described Disney as a cultural icon.[210] On\\nDisney\\'s death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the\\nvalues in Disney\\'s films are thos e \"considered valuable in American\\nChristian society\", which include \"individualism, decency, ... love for our\\nfellow man, fair play and toleration\".[211] Disney\\'s obituary in The Times\\ncalls the films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining ... of\\nincomparable artistry and of touching beauty\".[212] Journalist Bosley\\nCrowther  argu es that Disne y\\'s \"achievement as a creator of entertainment\\nfor an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of\\nhis wares  can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists  in\\nhistory.\"[5] Correspo ndent Alistair Cooke  calls Disney a \"folk-hero ... the\\nPied Piper of Holly wood\",[213] while Gabler cons iders Disney \"reshaped the\\nculture and the American consciousness\".[214] In the American Dictionary\\nof National Biography , Langer writes:\\nDisney remains the central figure in the history of animation.\\nThrough technological innovations and alliances with\\ngovernments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio\\nin a marginal form of communication into a multinational\\nleisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern,\\ncorporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values\\nhas possibly gained greater curren cy in the years after his\\ndeath.[58]\\nDisney in 1953, winning the\\nAcademy Award for Best\\nLive Action Short Film for\\nWater Birds (1952)In December 2021, the Metropolitan Mus eum of Art in New York open ed a\\nthree-month spec ial exhibit in honor of Disney titled \"Inspiring Walt\\nDisney\".[215]\\nDisney received 59 Academy Award\\nnominations, inclu ding 22 awards: both totals\\nare records.[216] He was nominated for three\\nGolden Globe Awards , but did not win, but he\\nwas pres ented with two Special Achievement\\nAwards — for Bambi  (1942) and The Living\\nDesert  (1953) — and the Cecil B.

By 1931 he was called Michael Maus in Germany , Michel Souris in\\nFrance, Miguel Ratonocito or Miguel Pericote in Spain and Miki Kuchi in\\nJapan.[63]\\nj. $1.5 million in 1937 equates to $31,791,667 in 2024; $6.5 million in\\n1939 equates to $142,719,424 in 2024, according to calculations based\\non the Consumer Price Index  measure of inflation.[82]\\nk. The citation for the award reads: \"T o Walt Disney for Snow White and\\nthe Seven Dwarfs, recognized as a significant screen innovation which\\nhas charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field for\\nthe motion picture cartoon.\"[83]\\nl. The trip inspired two combined live-action and animation works Saludos\\nAmigos  (1942) and The Three Caballeros  (1945).[89][90]\\nm. $4 million in 1944 equates to $69,232,514 in 2024, according to\\ncalculations based on the Consumer Price Index  measure of\\ninflation.[82]\\nn. These included Make Mine Music  (1946), Song of the South  (1946),\\nMelody T ime (1948) and So Dear to My Heart  (1949).[58]\\no. $2.2 million in 1950 equates to $27,860,581 in 2024; $8 million in 1950\\nequates to $101,31 1,203 in 2024, according to calculations based on\\nthe Consumer Price Index  measure of inflation.[82]\\np. The patriotic films include Johnny T remain  (1957), Old Yeller (1957),\\nTonka  (1958), Swiss Family Robinson  (1960), Polyanna  (1960).[58]\\nq. The Nine Old Men  consisted of Eric Larson , Wolfgang Reitherman , Les\\nClark , Milt Kahl , Ward Kimball , Marc Davis , Ollie Johnston , Frank\\nThomas  and John Lounsbery .[58]\\nr. Even repeats of the program proved more popular than all other\\ntelevision shows—aside from Lucille Ball \\'s I Love Lucy ; no ABC\\nprogram had ever been in the top 25 before Disneyland .[117]\\ns. The program, which was produced by Ward Kimball , was nominated for\\nan Academy Award for the Best Documentary (Short Subject)  at the\\n1957 Awards .[126]\\nt. Disney\\'s death in 1966, and opposition from conservationists, stopped\\nthe building of the resort.[135]\\nu. A long-standing urban legend  maintains that Disney was cryonically\\nfrozen .[145] Disney\\'s daughter Diane later stated, \"There is absolutely no\\ntruth to the rumor that my father , Walt Disney , wished to be\\nfrozen.\"[146][147]\\nv. Roy died two months later , in December 1971.[153]\\nw. One possible exception to the stable relationship was during the making\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs  (1937), where the stresses and\\nturmoil associated with the production led to the couple discussing\\ndivorce.[159]\\nx. Lillian had two miscarriages during the eight years between marriage\\nand the birth of Diane; she suf fered a further miscarriage shortly before\\nthe family adopted Sharon.[161]\\ny. Another example included animator Art Babbitt , organizer behind the\\n1941 strike at the studio and who held a well-known grudge against\\nDisney . Babbitt claimed in his later years that he saw Disney and his\\nlawyer attend meetings of the German American Bund , a pro-Nazi\\norganization, during the late 1930s.[186] However according to Gabler:\\n\"...that was highly unlikely , not only because W alt had little enough time\\nfor his family , much less political meetings, but because he had no real\\npolitical leanings at the time.\"[187] Disney\\'s of fice appointment book\\nmakes no mention of him attending Bund rallies, and no other\\nanimators ever made claims of Disney attending such meetings.[172]\\nz. Disney also demonstrated his political naivete in an October 1933 issue\\nof Overland Monthly  claiming: \"...there must be millions of people who\\nhave a downright feeling of animosity for our M. Mouse. Mr . A. Hitler ,\\nthe Nazi old thing, says that Mickey\\'s silly . Imagine that! W ell, Mickey is\\ngoing to save Mr . A Hitler from drowning or something some day . Just\\nwait and see if he doesn\\'t. Then won\\'t Mr . A. Hitler be\\nashamed!\"[172][189]\\naa. Examples include The Three Little Pigs  (in which the Big Bad W olf\\ncomes to the door dressed as a Jewish peddler) and The Opry House\\n(in which Mickey Mouse is dressed and dances as a Hasidic\\nJew).[191][192]\\nab. Other Jewish employees production manager Harry Tytle, and head of\\nmerchandising Kay Kamen , who once quipped that Disney\\'s New York\\noffice had \"more Jews than The Book of Leviticus\"[193]\\nac. Examples include Mickey\\'s Mellerdrammer , in which Mickey Mouse\\ndresses in blackface ; the black-colored bird in the short Who Killed\\nCock Robin ; the American Indians in Peter Pan ; and the crows in\\nDumbo  (although the case has been made that the crows were\\nsympathetic to Dumbo because they knew what it was like to be\\nostracized).[197]\\n1. \"Disney to Quit Post at Studio\"  (https://www .newspapers.com/image/38\\n0710879/) .

A\\npioneer of the American animation\\nindustry , he introduced  several\\ndevelopments in the production of\\ncartoons . As a film producer, he\\nholds the record for most Academy\\nAwards  earned and nominations by\\nan individ ual. He was presented with\\ntwo Golden Globe  Special\\nAchievement Awards and an Emmy\\nAward , among other honors. Several\\nof his films are included in the\\nNational Film Registry  by the\\nLibrary of Congress  and have also\\nbeen nam ed as some of the greatest\\nfilms ever  by the American Film\\nInstitute .\\nBorn in Chicago in 1901, Disney\\ndeveloped an early interest in\\ndrawing. He took art classes as a boy\\nand took a job as a commercial\\nillustrator at the age of 18. He moved\\nto Califor nia in the early 1920s and\\nentrepreneur\\nTitle President of The Walt\\nDisney Company[1]\\nSpouse Lillian Bounds  (m. 1925)\\nChildren 2, including Diane\\nDisney Miller\\nRelatives Disney family\\nAwards 26 Academy Awards[a]\\n3 Golden Globe Awards\\n1 Emmy Award\\nSignature\\nset up the Disne y Brothers Studio\\n(now The Walt Disney Company )\\nwith his brother Roy. With Ub\\nIwerks , he developed the character\\nMickey Mouse  in 1928 , his first\\nhighly popular success; he also\\nprovided the voice for his creation in\\nthe early  years. As the studio grew ,\\nhe became more adventurous,\\nintroducing synchronized sound ,\\nfull-color three-strip Technicolor ,\\nfeature-length  cartoons and\\ntechnical developm ents in cameras.\\nThe resul ts, seen in features such as\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\n(1937), Pinocchio , Fantasia  (both\\n1940), Dumbo  (1941), and Bambi\\n(1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and\\nlive-action films  followed  after World War II, including the critically\\nsuccessful Cinderella  (1950), Sleeping Beauty  (1959) and Mary Poppins\\n(1964), the last of which received five Academy Awards.\\nIn the 1950s, Disn ey expanded into the amusement park  industry, and in\\nJuly 1955 he opened Disneyland  in Anaheim, California . To fund the proje ct\\nhe diversified into television programs, such as Walt Disney\\'s Disneyland\\nand The Mick ey Mous e Club . He was also involved in planning the 1959\\nMoscow Fair, the 1960 Win ter Olympics , and the 1964 New  York World\\'s\\nFair. In 1965,  he began development of another theme park, Disney World ,\\nthe heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"Experimental Prototype\\nCommunity of Tomorrow \" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker\\nthroughout his life and died of lung cancer in 1966 before either the park or\\nthe EPCOT project were completed.\\nDisney\\'s childhood homeDisney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted\\na warm and outg oing public persona. He had high standards and high\\nexpectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been\\naccusations that he was racist  or antisemitic , they have been contradicted\\nby many who knew him. Historiography of Disney has taken a variety of\\nperspectives, rang ing from views of him as a purveyor of homely patriotic\\nvalues  to being a repres entative of American cultural imperialism . Wid ely\\nconsidered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th\\ncentury, Disney remains an important presence in the history of animation\\nand in the cultural history of the United States , where he is acknowledged\\nas a national cultural icon . His film work continues to be shown and\\nadapted, the Disney theme parks have grown in size and number to attract\\nvisitors in several countries and his company has grown to become one of\\nthe world\\'s largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates .\\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901,\\nat 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago\\'s\\nHermosa  neighborhood.[b] He was the\\nfourth son of Elias Disney — born in the\\nProvince of Canada , to Irish  parents — \\nand Flora (née Call), an Americ an of\\nGerman and English descent.[4][5][c]\\nAside from Walt, Elias and Flora\\'s sons\\nwere Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and\\nthe couple had a fifth child, Ruth , in\\nDecember 1903.[8] In 1906, when\\nDisney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missou ri, where\\nhis uncle  Robert had just purchased  land. In Marceline, Disney developed\\nhis interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired\\nneighborhood doctor.[9] Elias was a subs criber to the Appeal to Reason\\nnewspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-pageEarly life\\ncartoons of Ryan Walker.[10] He also began to develop an abilit y to work\\nwith watercolors and crayons.[5] He lived  near the Atchison, Topeka and\\nSanta Fe Railway  line and became enamored with trains.[11] He and his\\nyounger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School  in', metadata={'source': './docs/WaltDisney.pdf'}),\n",

Before long, Disney was spending\\nmore time at the Pfeiffers\\' house than at home.[15] Elias had purchased a\\nnewspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star  and Kansas City Times .\\nDisney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the\\nTimes  before school and repeated the round for the evening Star  after\\nschool. The schedule was exhausting , and Disney often received poor grades\\nafter falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than\\nsix years.[16] He atten ded Satu rday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute\\nand also took a correspondence course  in cartooning.[5][17]\\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company,\\nand moved back to the city with his family.[18] Disn ey enrolled at McKinley\\nHigh School  and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing\\npatriotic pictures about World War I;[19][20] he also took night courses at\\nthe Chicago Academy of Fine Arts .[21] In mid-1918, he attempted to join the\\nUnited States Army  to fight the Germans , but he was rejected as too young.\\nAfter forging the date of birth  on his birth certificate, he joined the Red\\nCross  in Septem ber 1918  as an ambulance  driver. He was shipped to France\\nbut arrive d in November, after the armis tice.[22] He drew cartoons on the\\nside of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in\\nthe army  newspaper Stars and Stripes .[23] He returned to Kansas City in\\nOctober 1919,[24] where he worked  as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-\\nWalt Disney\\'s business envelope\\nfeatured a self-portrait, c.\\u20091921.Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for\\nadvertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub\\nIwerks .[25]\\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin\\'s\\nrevenue declined  after Christmas,\\nDisney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid\\noff. They started their own business, the\\nshort-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial\\nArtists.[26] Failing to attract many\\ncustomers, Disney and Iwerks agreed\\nthat Disney should leave temporaril y to\\nearn money at the Kansas City Film Ad\\nCompany, run by A. V. Cauger; the\\nfollowing month Iwerks, who was not\\nable to run their business alone, also joined.[27] The company produced\\ncommercials using the cutout animation  technique.[28] Disney became\\ninterested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt\\nand Jeff and Max Fleischer \\'s Out of the Inkwell . With the assistance of a\\nborrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at\\nhome.[29][d] He came to the conclusion that cel anim ation  was more\\npromising than the cutout method.[e] Unable to persuad e Cauger to try cel\\nanimation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-wor ker\\nfrom the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman .[31] Their main client was the local\\nNewman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as\\n\"Newman\\'s Laugh -O-Grams\".[32] Disney studied Paul Terry\\'s  Aesop\\'s\\nFables  as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized\\nfairy tales.[33]Career\\nEarly career: 1920–1928\\nIn May 1921, the success of the \"Lau gh-O-Grams\" led to the establishment\\nof Laugh-O-Gram Studio , for which he hired more animators, including\\nFred Harman\\'s brother Hugh , Rudolf Ising  and Iwerks.[34] The Laugh-O-\\nGrams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the compa ny\\nsolvent, so Disney started production of Alice\\'s Wonderland  — based on\\nAlice\\'s Adventures in Wonderlan d — which combined live action with\\nanimation; he cast Virginia Davis  in the title role.[35] The result, a 12½-\\nminute, one-reel  film, was compl eted too late to save Laugh-O-Gram\\nStudio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.[36]\\nDisney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New\\nYork was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles\\nbecause his brothe r Roy was conval escing from tuberculosis  there,[37] and\\nhe hoped  to become a live-action film director.[38] Disney\\'s  efforts to sell\\nAlice\\'s Wonderland  were in vain until he heard from  New York film\\ndistributor Margaret J. Winkler . She was losing the rights to both the Out of\\nthe Inkwell  and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In\\nOctober, they signed a contract for six Alice  comedies , with an option for\\ntwo further series of six episodes each.[38][39] Disney and his brother Roy\\nformed the Disney Brothers Studio — which later became The Walt  Disney\\nCompany — to produce the films;[40][41] they persuaded Davis and her', metadata={'source': './docs/WaltDisney.pdf'}),\n",

In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwer ks,\\npersuading him to relocate to Hollyw ood from Kansas City.[42] In 1926,[43]\\nthe first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyper ion\\nAvenue; the building was demolished in 1940.[44]\\nBy 1926,  Winkler \\'s role in the distribution of the Alice  series had been\\nhanded over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although  the\\nrelationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.[45] The\\nseries ran until July 1927,[46] by which time Disney had begun to tire of it\\nand want ed to move away from the mixed format to all animation.[45][47]\\nAfter Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal\\nPictures , Disney and Iwer ks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , a character\\nDisney wanted to be \"peppy, alert,  saucy and venturesome, keeping him\\nalso neat and trim\".[47][48]\\nIn February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the\\nOswald  series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had\\nalso persuaded many of the artist s involved to work directly for him,\\nincluding Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell  and Friz Freleng . Disney also\\nfound out that Universal owned the intellectual proper ty rights  to Oswald.\\nMintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if\\nDisney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz\\'s ultimat um\\nand lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain\\nwith him.[49][50][f]\\nTo replac e Oswald , Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse , possibly\\ninspired by a pet mouse that Disn ey had adopted while working in his\\nLaugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are\\nunclear.[52][g] Disney\\'s  original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but\\nhis wife Lillian  thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey\\ninstead.[53][h] Iwerks revised Disney\\'s provisional sketches to make the\\ncharacter easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself\\nfrom the animatio n process,[55] provided  Mickey\\'s voice until 1947.  In the\\nwords of one Disn ey employee, \"Ub designed Mickey\\'s physical appearan ce,\\nbut Walt gave him his soul.\"[56]\\nMickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the\\nshort Plane Crazy , but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin\\' Gaucho ,\\nfailed to find a distributor.[57] Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz\\nSinger , Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat\\nWillie , to create the first post-produced sound cartoon . After the animationCreation of Mickey Mouse and following successes: 1928–\\n1934\\nThe first appearance of Mickey\\nMouse, in Steamboat Willie (1928)was complete, Disney signed a cont ract\\nwith the former executive of Universal\\nPictures, Pat Powers , to use the \"Powers\\nCinephone\" recording system;[58]\\nCinephone became the new distributor\\nfor Disney\\'s early sound cartoons, which\\nsoon became popular.[59]\\nTo improve the quality of the music,\\nDisney hired the professional composer\\nand arra nger Carl Stalling, on whose\\nsuggestion the Silly Symphony  series\\nwas developed, providing stories\\nthrough the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance  (1929),\\nwas drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were\\nseveral artists, both local and from New York.[60] Both the Mickey Mouse\\nand Silly Sym phonies  series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt\\nthey were  not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930,\\nDisney tried to trim  costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the\\npractice of drawing every frame individually in favor of the more effici ent\\ntechnique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the inbetween\\nposes . Disney asked Powers for an increa se in payments for the cartoons.\\nPowers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly\\nafterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.[61]\\nDisney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931 — which he blamed on the\\nmachinations of Powers and his own overwork — so he and Lillian took an\\nextended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.[62]\\nWith the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with\\nColumbia Pictures  to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became\\nincreasingly popu lar, including internationally.[63][64][i] Disney and his\\ncrew also introduc ed new cartoon stars like Pluto  in 1930, Goofy  in 1932\\nand Donald Duck in 1934.[65] Always keen to embrace new technology and\\nencouraged by his new contract with  United Artists , Disney filmed Flowers\\n7:47CC\\nand Tree s (1932) in full-colo r three-strip Technicolor ;[66] he was also able\\nto negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process\\nuntil August 31, 1935.[67] All subsequent Silly Sym phony  cartoons  were in', metadata={'source': './docs/WaltDisney.pdf'}),\n",

Disney had been nominated for another film in that category,\\nMickey\\'s Orphans , and received an Honorary Award  \"for the creation of\\nMickey Mouse\".[70][71]\\nIn 1933, Disney produced The Thre e Little Pigs , a film described by the\\nmedia historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all\\ntime\".[72] The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short\\nSubject (Cartoon) category. The film\\'s success led to a further increase in\\nthe studi o\\'s staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year.[73]\\nDisney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that\\nwould interest the audience,[74] and he invested in a \"story depart ment\"\\nseparate from the animators, with storyboard artists  who would detail the\\nplots of Disney\\'s films.[75]\\nBy 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing cartoon shorts,[65]\\nand belie ved a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable.[76] The\\nstudio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven\\nDwarfs , based on the fairy tale. When news leak ed out about the project,\\nmany in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company;\\nindustry insiders nicknamed it \"Disn ey\\'s Folly\".[77] The film, which was the\\nfirst anim ated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to\\nproduce — three times over budget.[78] To ensure the animation was as\\nrealistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard\\nArt Institute ;[79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that\\nthe anima tors could study realistic movement.[80] To portray the changing\\nperspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disne y\\'sGolden age of animation: 1934–1941\\nWalt Disney introduces each of the\\nseven dwarfs in a scene from the\\noriginal 1937 Snow White theatrical\\ntrailer.animators developed a multiplane\\ncamera  which allowed drawings on\\npieces of glass to be set at various\\ndistances from the camera, creating an\\nillusion of depth. The glass could be\\nmoved to create the impression of a\\ncamera passing through the scene. The\\nfirst work created on the camera — a\\nSilly Symphony  called The Old Mill\\n(1937) — won the Academy Award for\\nAnimated Short Film because of its\\nimpressive visual power. Although\\nSnow White  had been largely finished\\nby the time the multiplane camera had\\nbeen completed, Disney ordered som e scenes be re-drawn to use the new\\neffects.[81]\\nSnow White  premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and\\naudiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and\\nby May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful\\nsound film made to that date.[77][j] Disney won anoth er Honorary Academy\\nAward, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar\\nstatuettes.[83][k] The success of Snow White heralded  one of the most\\nproductive eras for the studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum  calls the\\nfollowing years \"the \\'Golden Age of Animation\\' \".[84][85] With work on Snow\\nWhite  finished, the studio began producing Pinocchio  in early 1938 and\\nFantasia  in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940,\\nand neither performed well at the box office — partly because revenues from\\nEurope had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio\\nincurred a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of\\nFebruary 1941.[86]\\nDisney drawing Goofy for a\\ngroup of girls in Argentina,\\n1941In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the\\ncompany\\'s first public stock offering  in 1940, and impl emented heavy salary\\ncuts. The latter measure, and Disney\\'s sometimes high-handed and\\ninsensitive manne r of dealing with  staff, led to a 1941 animators\\' strike\\nwhich lasted five weeks.[87] While a federal mediator from the National\\nLabor Relations Board  negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an\\noffer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs  to make a\\ngoodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolut ion\\nhe knew would be unfavorable to the studio.[88][l] Due to the strike — and\\nthe financial state of the company — several animators left the studio, and\\nDisney\\'s relationsh ip with other members of staff was permanently strained\\nas a result.[91] The strike temporarily interrupted the studio\\'s next\\nproduction, Dumbo  (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and\\ninexpensive mann er; the film receiv ed a positive reaction from audien ces\\nand critics alike.[92]\\nShortly after the release of Dumbo  in October\\n1941, the U.S. entered World War II.

Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more\\ncombined animat ion and live-action productions.[58][n] In 1948, Disney\\ninitiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life\\nAdventures , with  Seal Islan d the first;  the film won the Academy  Award in\\nthe Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)  category.[99]\\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella , his studio\\'s first animated\\nfeature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audienc es.\\nCosting $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first\\nyear.[100][o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous\\npictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature,\\nTreasure Island  (1950), which was shot in Britain , as was The Stor y of\\nRobin Hood and His Merrie Men  (1952).[101] Other all-live-action features\\nfollowed, many of which had patriotic themes.[58][p] He continued to\\nproduce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland\\n(1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to\\ndevote less attention to the animati on department, entrusting most of its\\noperations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men ,[q] although  he wasTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\\nDisney shows the plans of\\nDisneyland to officials from Orange\\nCounty in December 1954always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other\\nventures.[102] Around the sam e time, Disney established his own film\\ndistribution division Buena Vista , replacing his most recent distributor\\nRKO Pictures .[103]\\nFor several years Disney had been\\nconsidering building a theme park.\\nWhen he visited Griffith Park  in Los\\nAngeles with his daughters, he wan ted\\nto be in a clean, unspoiled park, where\\nboth children and their parents could\\nhave fun.[104] He visited the Tivoli\\nGardens  in Copenhagen, Denmark, and\\nwas heavily influenced by the\\ncleanliness and layout of the park.[105]\\nIn March 1952, he received zoning\\npermission to build a theme park in\\nBurbank, near the Disney studios.[106]\\nThis site proved too small, and a larger\\nplot in Anaheim , 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased. To\\ndistance the project from the studio  — which might attract the criticism of\\nshareholders — Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney\\nImagineering ) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and\\nanimators to work on the plans;[107][108] those involved became known as\\n\"Imagineers\".[109] After obtaining bank funding  he invited other\\nstockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres — part of\\nAmerican Broadc asting Company  (ABC) — and Western Printing  and\\nLithographing Company .[58] In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to\\nevery amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfa lls\\nor proble ms there were in the various locations and incorporated their\\nfindings into his design.[110] Construc tion work started in July 1954, and\\nDisneyland  opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on\\nABC, which reached 70 million viewers.[111] The park was designed as a\\nseries of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A. — a replica\\nof the main street in his hometown  of Marceline. The connected themed\\nareas were Adventureland , Frontierland , Fantasyland  and Tomorrowland .\\nThe park also contained the narrow gauge  Disneyland Railroad  that linked\\nthe lands ; around the outside of the park was a high berm  to separate the\\npark from the outside world.[112][113] An edito rial in The New York Times', metadata={'source': './docs/WaltDisney.pdf'})]"

Wid ely\\nconsidered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th\\ncentury, Disney remains an important presence in the history of animation\\nand in the cultural history of the United States , where he is acknowledged\\nas a national cultural icon . His film work continues to be shown and\\nadapted, the Disney theme parks have grown in size and number to attract\\nvisitors in several countries and his company has grown to become one of\\nthe world\\'s largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates .\\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901,\\nat 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago\\'s\\nHermosa  neighborhood.[b] He was the\\nfourth son of Elias Disney — born in the\\nProvince of Canada , to Irish  parents — \\nand Flora (née Call), an Americ an of\\nGerman and English descent.[4][5][c]\\nAside from Walt, Elias and Flora\\'s sons\\nwere Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and\\nthe couple had a fifth child, Ruth , in\\nDecember 1903.[8] In 1906, when\\nDisney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missou ri, where\\nhis uncle  Robert had just purchased  land. In Marceline, Disney developed\\nhis interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired\\nneighborhood doctor.[9] Elias was a subs criber to the Appeal to Reason\\nnewspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-pageEarly life\\ncartoons of Ryan Walker.[10] He also began to develop an abilit y to work\\nwith watercolors and crayons.[5] He lived  near the Atchison, Topeka and\\nSanta Fe Railway  line and became enamored with trains.[11] He and his\\nyounger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School  in\\nMarceline in late 1909.[12] The Disney fami ly were active members of a\\nCongregational church .[13]\\nIn 1911, the Disn eys moved to Kansas City, Missouri .[14] There, Disney\\nattended the Benton Grammar School , where he met fellow-student Walte r\\nPfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the\\nworld of vaudeville  and motion pictures. Before long, Disney was spending\\nmore time at the Pfeiffers\\' house than at home.[15] Elias had purchased a\\nnewspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star  and Kansas City Times .\\nDisney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the\\nTimes  before school and repeated the round for the evening Star  after\\nschool. The schedule was exhausting , and Disney often received poor grades\\nafter falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than\\nsix years.[16] He atten ded Satu rday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute\\nand also took a correspondence course  in cartooning.[5][17]\\nIn 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company,\\nand moved back to the city with his family.[18] Disn ey enrolled at McKinley\\nHigh School  and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing\\npatriotic pictures about World War I;[19][20] he also took night courses at\\nthe Chicago Academy of Fine Arts .[21] In mid-1918, he attempted to join the\\nUnited States Army  to fight the Germans , but he was rejected as too young.\\nAfter forging the date of birth  on his birth certificate, he joined the Red\\nCross  in Septem ber 1918  as an ambulance  driver. He was shipped to France\\nbut arrive d in November, after the armis tice.[22] He drew cartoons on the\\nside of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in\\nthe army  newspaper Stars and Stripes .[23] He returned to Kansas City in\\nOctober 1919,[24] where he worked  as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-\\nWalt Disney\\'s business envelope\\nfeatured a self-portrait, c.\\u20091921.Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for\\nadvertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub\\nIwerks .[25]\\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin\\'s\\nrevenue declined  after Christmas,\\nDisney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid\\noff. They started their own business, the\\nshort-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial\\nArtists.[26] Failing to attract many\\ncustomers, Disney and Iwerks agreed\\nthat Disney should leave temporaril y to\\nearn money at the Kansas City Film Ad\\nCompany, run by A. V. Cauger; the\\nfollowing month Iwerks, who was not\\nable to run their business alone, also joined.[27] The company produced\\ncommercials using the cutout animation  technique.[28] Disney became\\ninterested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt\\nand Jeff and Max Fleischer \\'s Out of the Inkwell . With the assistance of a\\nborrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at\\nhome.[29][d] He came to the conclusion that cel anim ation  was more\\npromising than the cutout method.[e] Unable to persuad e Cauger to try cel\\nanimation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-wor ker\\nfrom the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman .[31] Their main client was the local\\nNewman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as\\n\"Newman\\'s Laugh -O-Grams\".[32] Disney studied Paul Terry\\'s  Aesop\\'s\\nFables  as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized\\nfairy tales.[33]Career\\nEarly career: 1920–1928\\nIn May 1921, the success of the \"Lau gh-O-Grams\" led to the establishment\\nof Laugh-O-Gram Studio , for which he hired more animators, including\\nFred Harman\\'s brother Hugh , Rudolf Ising  and Iwerks.[34] The Laugh-O-\\nGrams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the compa ny\\nsolvent, so Disney started production of Alice\\'s Wonderland  — based on\\nAlice\\'s Adventures in Wonderlan d — which combined live action with\\nanimation; he cast Virginia Davis  in the title role.[35] The result, a 12½-\\nminute, one-reel  film, was compl eted too late to save Laugh-O-Gram\\nStudio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.[36]\\nDisney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New\\nYork was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles\\nbecause his brothe r Roy was conval escing from tuberculosis  there,[37] and\\nhe hoped  to become a live-action film director.[38] Disney\\'s  efforts to sell\\nAlice\\'s Wonderland  were in vain until he heard from  New York film\\ndistributor Margaret J. Winkler . She was losing the rights to both the Out of\\nthe Inkwell  and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In\\nOctober, they signed a contract for six Alice  comedies , with an option for\\ntwo further series of six episodes each.[38][39] Disney and his brother Roy\\nformed the Disney Brothers Studio — which later became The Walt  Disney\\nCompany — to produce the films;[40][41] they persuaded Davis and her\\nfamily to relocate to Hollywood  to conti nue prod uction, with Davis on\\ncontract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwer ks,\\npersuading him to relocate to Hollyw ood from Kansas City.[42] In 1926,[43]\\nthe first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyper ion\\nAvenue; the building was demolished in 1940.[44]\\nBy 1926,  Winkler \\'s role in the distribution of the Alice  series had been\\nhanded over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although  the\\nrelationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.[45] The\\nseries ran until July 1927,[46] by which time Disney had begun to tire of it\\nand want ed to move away from the mixed format to all animation.[45][47]\\nAfter Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal\\nPictures , Disney and Iwer ks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , a character\\nDisney wanted to be \"peppy, alert,  saucy and venturesome, keeping him\\nalso neat and trim\".[47][48]\\nIn February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the\\nOswald  series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had\\nalso persuaded many of the artist s involved to work directly for him,\\nincluding Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell  and Friz Freleng . Disney also\\nfound out that Universal owned the intellectual proper ty rights  to Oswald.\\nMintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if\\nDisney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz\\'s ultimat um\\nand lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain\\nwith him.[49][50][f]\\nTo replac e Oswald , Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse , possibly\\ninspired by a pet mouse that Disn ey had adopted while working in his\\nLaugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are\\nunclear.[52][g] Disney\\'s  original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but\\nhis wife Lillian  thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey\\ninstead.[53][h] Iwerks revised Disney\\'s provisional sketches to make the\\ncharacter easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself\\nfrom the animatio n process,[55] provided  Mickey\\'s voice until 1947.  In the\\nwords of one Disn ey employee, \"Ub designed Mickey\\'s physical appearan ce,\\nbut Walt gave him his soul.\"[56]\\nMickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the\\nshort Plane Crazy , but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin\\' Gaucho ,\\nfailed to find a distributor.[57] Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz\\nSinger , Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat\\nWillie , to create the first post-produced sound cartoon . After the animationCreation of Mickey Mouse and following successes: 1928–\\n1934\\nThe first appearance of Mickey\\nMouse, in Steamboat Willie (1928)was complete, Disney signed a cont ract\\nwith the former executive of Universal\\nPictures, Pat Powers , to use the \"Powers\\nCinephone\" recording system;[58]\\nCinephone became the new distributor\\nfor Disney\\'s early sound cartoons, which\\nsoon became popular.[59]\\nTo improve the quality of the music,\\nDisney hired the professional composer\\nand arra nger Carl Stalling, on whose\\nsuggestion the Silly Symphony  series\\nwas developed, providing stories\\nthrough the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance  (1929),\\nwas drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were\\nseveral artists, both local and from New York.[60] Both the Mickey Mouse\\nand Silly Sym phonies  series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt\\nthey were  not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930,\\nDisney tried to trim  costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the\\npractice of drawing every frame individually in favor of the more effici ent\\ntechnique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the inbetween\\nposes . Disney asked Powers for an increa se in payments for the cartoons.\\nPowers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly\\nafterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.[61]\\nDisney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931 — which he blamed on the\\nmachinations of Powers and his own overwork — so he and Lillian took an\\nextended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.[62]\\nWith the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with\\nColumbia Pictures  to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became\\nincreasingly popu lar, including internationally.[63][64][i] Disney and his\\ncrew also introduc ed new cartoon stars like Pluto  in 1930, Goofy  in 1932\\nand Donald Duck in 1934.[65] Always keen to embrace new technology and\\nencouraged by his new contract with  United Artists , Disney filmed Flowers\\n7:47CC\\nand Tree s (1932) in full-colo r three-strip Technicolor ;[66] he was also able\\nto negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process\\nuntil August 31, 1935.[67] All subsequent Silly Sym phony  cartoons  were in\\ncolor.[68] Flowers and Trees  was popular with audiences[69] and won the\\ninaugural Academy Award  for best Short Subject (Cartoon)  at the 1932\\nceremony . Disney had been nominated for another film in that category,\\nMickey\\'s Orphans , and received an Honorary Award  \"for the creation of\\nMickey Mouse\".[70][71]\\nIn 1933, Disney produced The Thre e Little Pigs , a film described by the\\nmedia historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all\\ntime\".[72] The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short\\nSubject (Cartoon) category. The film\\'s success led to a further increase in\\nthe studi o\\'s staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year.[73]\\nDisney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that\\nwould interest the audience,[74] and he invested in a \"story depart ment\"\\nseparate from the animators, with storyboard artists  who would detail the\\nplots of Disney\\'s films.[75]\\nBy 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing cartoon shorts,[65]\\nand belie ved a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable.[76] The\\nstudio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven\\nDwarfs , based on the fairy tale. When news leak ed out about the project,\\nmany in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company;\\nindustry insiders nicknamed it \"Disn ey\\'s Folly\".[77] The film, which was the\\nfirst anim ated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to\\nproduce — three times over budget.[78] To ensure the animation was as\\nrealistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard\\nArt Institute ;[79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that\\nthe anima tors could study realistic movement.[80] To portray the changing\\nperspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disne y\\'sGolden age of animation: 1934–1941\\nWalt Disney introduces each of the\\nseven dwarfs in a scene from the\\noriginal 1937 Snow White theatrical\\ntrailer.animators developed a multiplane\\ncamera  which allowed drawings on\\npieces of glass to be set at various\\ndistances from the camera, creating an\\nillusion of depth. The glass could be\\nmoved to create the impression of a\\ncamera passing through the scene. The\\nfirst work created on the camera — a\\nSilly Symphony  called The Old Mill\\n(1937) — won the Academy Award for\\nAnimated Short Film because of its\\nimpressive visual power. Although\\nSnow White  had been largely finished\\nby the time the multiplane camera had\\nbeen completed, Disney ordered som e scenes be re-drawn to use the new\\neffects.[81]\\nSnow White  premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and\\naudiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and\\nby May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful\\nsound film made to that date.[77][j] Disney won anoth er Honorary Academy\\nAward, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar\\nstatuettes.[83][k] The success of Snow White heralded  one of the most\\nproductive eras for the studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum  calls the\\nfollowing years \"the \\'Golden Age of Animation\\' \".[84][85] With work on Snow\\nWhite  finished, the studio began producing Pinocchio  in early 1938 and\\nFantasia  in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940,\\nand neither performed well at the box office — partly because revenues from\\nEurope had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio\\nincurred a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of\\nFebruary 1941.[86]\\nDisney drawing Goofy for a\\ngroup of girls in Argentina,\\n1941In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the\\ncompany\\'s first public stock offering  in 1940, and impl emented heavy salary\\ncuts. The latter measure, and Disney\\'s sometimes high-handed and\\ninsensitive manne r of dealing with  staff, led to a 1941 animators\\' strike\\nwhich lasted five weeks.[87] While a federal mediator from the National\\nLabor Relations Board  negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an\\noffer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs  to make a\\ngoodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolut ion\\nhe knew would be unfavorable to the studio.[88][l] Due to the strike — and\\nthe financial state of the company — several animators left the studio, and\\nDisney\\'s relationsh ip with other members of staff was permanently strained\\nas a result.[91] The strike temporarily interrupted the studio\\'s next\\nproduction, Dumbo  (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and\\ninexpensive mann er; the film receiv ed a positive reaction from audien ces\\nand critics alike.[92]\\nShortly after the release of Dumbo  in October\\n1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney\\nformed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit\\nwithin the company to produce instruction\\nfilms for the military such as Four Methods of\\nFlush Riveting  and Aircraft Production\\nMethods .[93] Disney also met with Henry\\nMorgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury ,\\nand agreed to produce short Donald Duck\\ncartoons to promote war bonds .[94] Disney also\\nproduced several  propaganda prod uctions ,\\nincluding shorts such as Der Fueh rer\\'s Face — \\nwhich won an Academy Award — and the 1943\\nfeature film Victory Through Air Power .[95]World War II and beyond: 1941–1950\\nThe milit ary films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the\\nfeature film Bambi  — which had been in production since 1937 — \\nunderperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box\\noffice.[96] On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio  and Fantasia , the\\ncompany had debts of $4 million with the Bank of America  in 1944.[97][m]\\nAt a mee ting with  Bank of America  executives to discuss the future of the\\ncompany, the bank\\'s chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini , told his\\nexecutives, \"I\\'ve been watching the Disneys\\' pictures quite closely because I\\nknew we were lending them money far above the financial risk. ... They\\'re\\ngood this year, they\\'re good next year, and they\\'re good the year after. ...\\nYou have  to relax and give them time to market their product.\"[98] Disney\\'s\\nproduction of short films decrease d in the late 1940s, coinciding with\\nincreasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros.  and\\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer . Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more\\ncombined animat ion and live-action productions.[58][n] In 1948, Disney\\ninitiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life\\nAdventures , with  Seal Islan d the first;  the film won the Academy  Award in\\nthe Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)  category.[99]\\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella , his studio\\'s first animated\\nfeature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audienc es.\\nCosting $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first\\nyear.[100][o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous\\npictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature,\\nTreasure Island  (1950), which was shot in Britain , as was The Stor y of\\nRobin Hood and His Merrie Men  (1952).[101] Other all-live-action features\\nfollowed, many of which had patriotic themes.[58][p] He continued to\\nproduce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland\\n(1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to\\ndevote less attention to the animati on department, entrusting most of its\\noperations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men ,[q] although  he wasTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\\nDisney shows the plans of\\nDisneyland to officials from Orange\\nCounty in December 1954always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other\\nventures.[102] Around the sam e time, Disney established his own film\\ndistribution division Buena Vista , replacing his most recent distributor\\nRKO Pictures .[103]\\nFor several years Disney had been\\nconsidering building a theme park.\\nWhen he visited Griffith Park  in Los\\nAngeles with his daughters, he wan ted\\nto be in a clean, unspoiled park, where\\nboth children and their parents could\\nhave fun.[104] He visited the Tivoli\\nGardens  in Copenhagen, Denmark, and\\nwas heavily influenced by the\\ncleanliness and layout of the park.[105]\\nIn March 1952, he received zoning\\npermission to build a theme park in\\nBurbank, near the Disney studios.[106]\\nThis site proved too small, and a larger\\nplot in Anaheim , 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased. To\\ndistance the project from the studio  — which might attract the criticism of\\nshareholders — Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney\\nImagineering ) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and\\nanimators to work on the plans;[107][108] those involved became known as\\n\"Imagineers\".[109] After obtaining bank funding  he invited other\\nstockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres — part of\\nAmerican Broadc asting Company  (ABC) — and Western Printing  and\\nLithographing Company .[58] In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to\\nevery amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfa lls\\nor proble ms there were in the various locations and incorporated their\\nfindings into his design.[110] Construc tion work started in July 1954, and\\nDisneyland  opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on\\nABC, which reached 70 million viewers.[111] The park was designed as a\\nseries of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A. — a replica\\nof the main street in his hometown  of Marceline. The connected themed\\nareas were Adventureland , Frontierland , Fantasyland  and Tomorrowland .\\nThe park also contained the narrow gauge  Disneyland Railroad  that linked\\nthe lands ; around the outside of the park was a high berm  to separate the\\npark from the outside world.[112][113] An edito rial in The New York Times\\nconsidered that Disney had \"tastefully combined some of the pleas ant\\nthings of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow\".[114] Although\\nthere were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a\\nmonth\\'s operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by\\nthe end of its first year, it attracted 3.6 million guests.[115]\\nThe money from ABC was continge nt on Disney television programs.[116]\\nThe studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christm as\\nDay 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland . Roy believed the\\nprogram added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to\\nshareholders, he wrote that \"television can be a most powerful selling aid\\nfor us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise\\nthat we enter television when we do\".[58] In 1954, after the Disneyland\\nfunding had been agreed, ABC broadcast Walt Disney\\'s Disneyland , an\\nanthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other\\nmaterial from the studio\\'s library. The show was successful in terms of\\nratings and profits, earning an audi ence share of over 50%.[117][r] In April\\n1955, Newsweek  called the series an \"American institution\".[118] ABC was\\npleased with the ratings, leading to Disney\\'s first daily television program,\\nThe Mick ey Mouse Club , a variety show catering specifically to children.[119]\\nThe program was accompanied by merchandising through vario us\\ncompanies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring\\nbooks and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connec ted\\nto the show).[120] One of the segments of Disneyland  consisted of the five-\\npart miniseries  Davy Crockett  which, according to Disney biograp her Neal\\nGabler , \"became an overnight sensation\".[121] The show\\'s theme song, \"The\\nDisney in 1954Ballad of Davy Crockett \", became internationally popular, and ten million\\nrecords were sold.[122] As a result, Disney formed his own record\\nproduction and distribution entity, Disneyland Records .[123]\\nAs well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects\\naway from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 American National\\nExhibition  in Moscow; Disney Studios\\' contribution was America the\\nBeautiful , a 19-minute film in the 360-degre e Circarama theater  that was\\none of the most popular attractions.[58] The follo wing year he acted as the\\nchairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Win ter Olympics  in\\nSquaw Valley, California , where he designe d the opening, closing and medal\\nceremonies .[124] He was one of twelve investors in the Celebrity Sports\\nCenter , which opened in 1960 in Glendale, Colorad o; he and Roy bought\\nout the others in 1962, making the Disney company the sole owner.[125]\\nDespite the demands wrought by non-studio\\nprojects, Disney continued to work on film and\\ntelevision projects. In 1955, he was involved in\\n\"Man in Space \", an episode of the Disneyland\\nseries, which was made in collabor ation with\\nNASA  rocket designer Wernher von Braun .[s]\\nDisney also oversa w aspects of the full-length\\nfeatures Lady and the Tramp  (the first\\nanimated film in CinemaScope ) in 1955,\\nSleeping Beauty  (the first anima ted film in\\nTechnirama  70 mm film) in 1959, One\\nHundred and One Dalmatians  (the first\\nanimated feature film to use Xerox cels) in\\n1961, and The Sword in the Stone  in 1963.[127]\\nIn 1964, Disney produced Mary Poppins , based on the book series  by P. L.\\nTravers ; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the\\n1940s.[128] It becam e the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although\\nTravers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights.[129]\\nThe same  year he also became invo lved in plans to expand the California\\nInstitute of the Arts  (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw\\nup blueprints for a new building.[130]\\nDisney provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair, for\\nwhich he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo ,\\nwho plan ned a tribute to UNICEF , Disney developed It\\'s a Small World , a\\nboat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world;\\nGreat Moments with Mr. Lincoln  contained an animatronic Abraham\\nLincoln  giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress  promoted\\nthe importance of electricity; and Ford\\'s Magic Skyway portrayed the\\nprogress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibits — principally concepts\\nand technology — were re-installed in Disneyland, although It\\'s a Small\\nWorld is the ride that most closely resembles the original.[131][132]\\nDuring the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a ski resort  in\\nMineral King, a glacial  valley in California\\'s Sierra Nevada . He hired  experts\\nsuch as the reno wned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy\\nSchaeffler .[133] [134][t] With income from Disneyland accounting for an\\nincreasing proportion of the studio\\'s income, Disney continued to look for\\nvenues for other attractions. In 1963, he presented a project to creat e a\\ntheme park in downtown St. Louis , Missouri; he initially reached an\\nagreement with the Civic Center Redevelopment Corp, which controlled the\\nland, but the deal later collapsed over funding.[136][137] In late 1965, he\\nannounced plans to develop anoth er theme park to be called \"Disney\\nWorld\" (now Walt Disney World ), a few miles southwest of Orlando,\\nFlorida . Disney World was to include the \"Magic Kingdom\" — a larger and\\nmore elab orate version of Disneyland — plus golf courses and resort hotels.\\nThe hear t of Disney World was to be the \"Experimental Prototy pe\\nCommunity of Tomorrow\" ( EPCOT ),[138] which he described as:\\nan experimental prototype commu nity of tomorrow that will\\ntake its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are\\nnow emer ging from the creative centers of American industry. It\\nGrave of Walt Disney at\\nForest Lawn, Glendalewill be a commun ity of tomorrow that will never be completed,\\nbut will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating\\nnew materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a\\nshowcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of\\nAmerican free enterprise.[139]\\nDuring 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT.[140]\\nHe receiv ed a story credit in the 1966 film Lt. Robin  Crusoe, U.S.N.  as\\nRetlaw Yensid, his name spelt backw ards.[141] He incre ased his involvement\\nin the studio\\'s films, and was heavil y involved in the story development  of\\nThe Jungle Book , the live-action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire\\n(both 1967) and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\\n(1968).[142]\\nDisney had been a heavy smoker  since World\\nWar I.

On\\nNovember 30, he felt unwell and was taken by\\nambulance from his home to St. Joseph\\nHospital  where, on December 15, at age 65, he\\ndied of circulatory collap se caused by the\\ncancer.[143] His remains were cremated two\\ndays later and his ashes interred at the Forest\\nLawn Memorial Park  in Glendale,\\nCalifornia .[144][u]\\nThe release of The Jungle Book  and The Happiest Millionaire  in 1967\\nraised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to\\n81.[19] When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day  was released in 1968, itIllness, death and aftermath\\nExternal videos\\n Interview with Neal Gabler on\\nWalt Disney: The Triumph of the\\nAmerican Imagination, November\\n19, 2006 (https://www.c-span.org/vid\\neo/?195399-10/walt-disney), C-\\nSPANearned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category,\\nawarded posthumously.[148] After Disney\\'s death, his studios continued to\\nproduce live-action films prolificall y while the quality of their animated\\nfilms was allowed to languish. In the late 1980s, this trend was reversed in\\nwhat The New  York Times  describe s as the \"Disney Renaissance \" that\\nbegan with The Little Mermaid  (1989).[149] Disney\\'s studios continue to\\nproduce successful film, television and stage entertainment.[150]\\nDisney\\'s plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition.\\nAfter Disney\\'s death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full\\ncontrol of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a\\ntown to an attraction.[151] At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt\\nDisney World to his brother.[152][v] Walt Disney Wor ld expanded with the\\nopening of Epcot Center  in 1982;  Walt Disney\\'s vision of a functional city\\nwas replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world\\'s fair.[154] In 2009,\\nthe Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney\\'s daughter Diane and\\nher son Walter E. D. Miller, opened  in the Presidio of San Francisco .[155]\\nThousands of artifacts from Disney\\'s life and career are on display,\\nincluding numerous awards that he received.[156] In 2014, the Disne y theme\\nparks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.[157]\\nEarly in 1925, Disney hired an ink\\nartist, Lillian Bounds . They married in\\nJuly of that year, at her brothe r\\'s\\nhouse in her home town of Lewiston,\\nIdaho .[158] The marriage was generally\\nhappy, according to Lillian, although\\naccording to Disney\\'s biographer Neal\\nGabler  she did not \"accept Walt\\'s\\ndecisions meekly or his status\\nunquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people \\'howPersonal life and character\\nDisney family at Schiphol Airport\\n(1951)henpecked he is\\'.\"[159][w] Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood\\nsocial scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts,\\n\"content with household management and providing support for her\\nhusband\".[160] Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane  (born\\nDecember 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks\\npreviously).[161][x] Within the famil y, neither Disney nor his wife hid the\\nfact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people\\noutside the family raised the point.[162] The Disneys were  careful to keep\\ntheir daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the\\nlight of the Lindbergh kidnap ping ; Disney took steps to ensure his\\ndaughters were not photographed by the press.[163]\\nIn 1949, Disney and his family move d to\\na new home in the Holmby Hills  district\\nof Los Angeles. With the help of his\\nfriends Ward and Betty Kimball , who\\nalready had their own backyard\\nrailroad , Disney developed blueprints\\nand immediately set to work on creating\\na miniature live steam  railroad for his\\nback yard. The name of the railroad,\\nCarolwood Pacific Railroad , came from\\nhis home\\'s location on Carolwood Drive.\\nThe miniature working steam\\nlocomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie , and\\nDisney named it Lilly Belle after his wife;[164] after three years Disney\\nordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.[165]\\nDisney grew more politically conserv ative  as he got older. A Democratic\\nParty  supporter until the 1940 presidential election , when he switched\\nallegiance to the Republican Party ,[166] he beca me a generous donor to\\nThomas E. Dewey \\'s 1944 bid for the presidency .[167] In 1946, he was a\\nfounding member  of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of\\nAmerican Ideals , an orga nization who stated they \"believ[ed] in, and like,\\nthe Amer ican Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt agains t a\\nrising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by\\nsubversive means to undermine and change this way of life\".[168] In 1947,\\nduring the Second Red Scare , Disney testified before the House Un-\\nAmerican Activities Committee  (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell ,\\nDavid Hilberman  and William Pomerance , former animators and labor\\nunion  organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike\\nled by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence  in\\nHollywood.[169][170]\\nThe New York Times  reported in 1993  that Disney had been an FBI\\ninformant passing  secret information to J. Edgar Hoover about communist\\nactivities in Hollywood.[171] However, while Walt Disney was made a\\n\"Special Agent in Charge Contact\" in 1954, FBI officials claim this was\\nlargely an honorary title regularly awarded to members of a community\\nwho might be of use to the bureau.[172][173] The FBI declass ified and\\nreleased Walt Disney\\'s file on their website, and revealed that much of\\nDisney\\'s correspondence with the bureau (via studio personnel) was in\\nrelation to the production of educational films ; such as a certain installment\\nof the \"Career Day\" newsreel  segments  on The Mick ey Mouse Club  focusing\\non the bureau (which aired in Janu ary 1958), as well as an unmade 1961\\neducational short warning children about the dangers of child\\nmolestation .[172][174]\\nDisney\\'s public persona was very different from his actual personality.[175]\\nPlaywright Robert E. Sherwood  described him as \"almost painfully shy ...\\ndiffident\" and self-deprecating.[176] According to his biographer Richard\\nSchickel , Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public\\nidentity.[177] Kimball argues that Disney \"played the role of a bashful tycoon\\nwho was embarrassed in public\" and knew that he was doing so.[178] Disney\\nacknowledged the façade and told a friend that \"I\\'m not Walt Disney. I do a\\nlot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke . I\\nsmoke. Walt Disney does not drink . I drink.\"[179] Critic Otis Ferg uson , in\\nThe New  Republic , called the private  Disney: \"common and everyday, not\\nA portrait of Disney with\\ncartoon representations of\\ndifferent nationalities on a 6\\ncent U.S. postage stamp,\\n1968inaccessible, not in a foreign langu age, not suppressed or sponsored or\\nanything. Just Disney.\"[178] Many of those with whom Disney worked\\ncommented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his\\nexceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said\\n\"That\\'ll work\", it was an indication  of high praise.[180] Instead of direct\\napproval, Disney  gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or\\nrecommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would\\nbe passed on.[181]\\nViews of Disney and his work have changed\\nover the decade s, and there have been\\npolarized opinions.[182] Mark Langer, in the\\nAmerican Dictionary of National Biography ,\\nwrites that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney\\nhailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and\\npopularizer of culture. More recently, Disney\\nhas been regarded as a paradigm of American\\nimperialism  and intolerance, as well as a\\ndebaser of culture. \"[58] Stev en Watts wrot e that\\nsome denounce Disney \"as a cynical\\nmanipulator of cultural and commercial\\nformulas\",[182] while PBS  reco rds that critics\\nhave cens ured his work because of its \"smooth\\nfaçade of sentimentality and stubborn\\noptimism, its feel-good re-write of American\\nhistory\".[183]\\nDisney has been accused of anti-Semitism  for\\nhaving given Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl  a tour of his studio a\\nmonth after Kristallnacht .[184] Disney disavowed the tour three months\\nlater, saying he was unaware who she was when he received the\\ninvitation.[185] It has been suggested that Riefenst ahl\\'s visit was also likelyReputation\\nfinancially motivated as an attempt by Disney to recover more than 135,0 00\\nReichmarks  owed from his German film distributor and to get the ban on\\nDisney films lifted in Germany.[172][y] According to Disn ey biographer Neal\\nGabler, Disney was apolitical  and \"som ething of a political naïf\" during the\\n1930s and he had previously told one reporter – as tensions in Europe were\\nbrewing – that America should \"let \\'em fight their own wars\" claiming  he\\nhad \"learned my lesson\" from World War I.[188][z] During World War II,\\nDisney was actively involved in maki ng propaganda films against the Nazis,\\nboth for the general public (such as Der Fuehrer\\'s Face  and Education for\\nDeath ), as well as educa tional and training films exclusively for the United\\nStates Government . As early as March 1941 (sever al months before\\nAmerica\\'s entry into the war) Disney began offering his services to various\\nbranches of the United States Armed Forces  to make training films \"...for\\nnational defence industries at cost and without profit. In making this offer,\\nI am motivated solely by a desire to help as best I can in the present\\nemergency.\"[190] Since many of these training films contained highly\\nclassified informat ion and required the highest level of security clearance  to\\nbe viewed, if Disn ey had any previous sympathies towards Nazi Germa ny,\\nthe U.S. Governme nt would have likely disqualified him from making these\\nfilms.[172]\\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum  acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes\\ncommon to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons[aa] but\\nalso points out that Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities and was\\nnamed the 1955 \"Man of the Year\" by the B\\'nai B\\'rith chapter in Beverly\\nHills.[191][192] the organization itself found no evidence of anti-Semitism on\\nDisney\\'s part. The plaque read: \"For exemplifying the best tenets of\\nAmerican citizensh ip and inter-group understanding and interpreting into\\naction the ideals of B\\'nai B\\'rith. \"[172] Disney had numerous Jewish\\nemployees, many  of whom were in influential positions.[193] Non e of\\nDisney\\'s employees including animator Art Babbitt , who disliked Disney\\nintensely – ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.[187]\\nJewish story man Joe Grant , who worked closely with Disney throughout\\nthe 1930s  and 1940s stated, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, there was no evidence\\nof anti-Semitism. I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried\\ndeep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the\\nstudio were Jewish. It\\'s much ado about nothing. I never once had a\\nproblem with him in that way.\"[172][ab] In addition songwriter Robert B.\\nSherman  recalled that when one of Disney\\'s lawyers made anti-Semitic\\nremarks towards him and his brother Richard , Disney defended them and\\nfired the attorney.[194][172] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted\\naccess to the Disney archives, conc ludes that the available evidence does\\nnot support accusations of anti-Sem itism and that Disney largely got that\\nreputation due to his association with Motion Picture Alliance for the\\nPreservation of American Ideals  – an anti-Communist organization formed\\nin 1944, that was rumored to have anti-Semitic undertones. Gabler\\nconcludes that \"...though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-\\nSemitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-\\nSemitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expung e it\\nthroughout his life.\"[195] Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture\\nAlliance, and had no involvement with the organization after 1947.[196]\\nAccording to Disney\\'s daughter Diane Disney-Miller , her sister Sharon\\ndated a Jewish boyfriend for a perio d of time, to which her father raised no\\nobjections and even reportedly said, \"Sharon, I think it\\'s wonderful how\\nthese Jewish families have accepted you.\"[172]\\nDisney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his\\nproductions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially\\ninsensitive material.[197][ac] Gabler argues that \"Walt Disney was no racist.\\nHe never, either publicly or privat ely, made disparaging remarks about\\nblacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his\\ngeneration, however, he was racially insensitive.\"[197] The feature film Song\\nof the South  was criticized by contemporary film critics, the NAACP , and\\nothers for its perpetuation of black stereotypes ,[198] but during filming\\nDisney became close friends with its star, James Baskett , describing him in\\na letter to his sister Ruth as \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered  in\\nyears.\"[199] Disney and Baskett stayed in contact long after the film\\'s\\nproduction, with Walt even sending him gifts. When Baskett was in failing\\nhealth, Disney not only began financially supporting him and his family, but\\nalso campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academ y Award  for his\\nperformance, making Baskett the first black actor so honored.[199] Baskett\\ndied shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for\\nhis support claiming he had been a \"friend in deed and [we] certainly have\\nbeen in need.\"[200][172] Floyd Norman , the studio\\'s first black animator who\\nworked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did\\nI observe  a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused  of\\nafter his death. His treatment of people — and by this I mean all people — can\\nonly be called exemplary.\"[201]\\nWatts argues that many of Disney\\'s  post-World War II films \"legislated a\\nkind of cultural Marshall Plan . They nourished a genial cultural imperialis m\\nthat mag ically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectatio ns,\\nand goods of a prosperous middle-c lass United States.\"[202] Film  historian\\nJay P. Telotte  ackn owledges that many see Disney\\'s studio as an \"agent of\\nmanipulation and repression\", although he observes that it has \"labo red\\nthroughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and\\nfantasy\".[203] John Tomlinson, in his study Cultural Imperialism , examines\\nthe work of Ariel Dorfman  and Armand Mattelart , whose 1971 book Para\\nleer al Pato Donald  (transl.  How to Read Donald Duck ) identifies that\\nthere are \"imperia list ... values \\'conc ealed\\' behind the innocent, wholesome\\nfaçade of the world of Walt Disney\"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"it\\npresents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.\"[204]\\nTomlinson views their argument as flawed, as \"they simply assume  that\\nreading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the\\naffluent ... [\\' Yankee \\'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".[205]\\nDisney has been portrayed numerou s times in fictional works. H. G. Wells\\nreferences Disney in his 1938 novel The Holy Terror , in which World\\nDictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator.[206]\\nDisney was portray ed by Len Cariou  in the 1995 made- for-TV film A Dream\\nIs a Wish  Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story ,[207] and by Tom\\nHanks  in the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks .[208] In 2001, the Germ an author\\nPeter Step han Jungk publishe d Der Köni g von Amerika  (trans: The King  of\\nAmerica ), a fiction al work of Disney\\'s later years that re-imagines him as a\\npower-hungry racist. The composer Philip Glass  later adapted the book into\\nthe opera The Perfect American  (2013).[209]\\nSeveral commentators have described Disney as a cultural icon.[210] On\\nDisney\\'s death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the\\nvalues in Disney\\'s films are thos e \"considered valuable in American\\nChristian society\", which include \"individualism, decency, ... love for our\\nfellow man, fair play and toleration\".[211] Disney\\'s obituary in The Times\\ncalls the films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining ... of\\nincomparable artistry and of touching beauty\".[212] Journalist Bosley\\nCrowther  argu es that Disne y\\'s \"achievement as a creator of entertainment\\nfor an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of\\nhis wares  can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists  in\\nhistory.\"[5] Correspo ndent Alistair Cooke  calls Disney a \"folk-hero ... the\\nPied Piper of Holly wood\",[213] while Gabler cons iders Disney \"reshaped the\\nculture and the American consciousness\".[214] In the American Dictionary\\nof National Biography , Langer writes:\\nDisney remains the central figure in the history of animation.\\nThrough technological innovations and alliances with\\ngovernments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio\\nin a marginal form of communication into a multinational\\nleisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern,\\ncorporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values\\nhas possibly gained greater curren cy in the years after his\\ndeath.[58]\\nDisney in 1953, winning the\\nAcademy Award for Best\\nLive Action Short Film for\\nWater Birds (1952)In December 2021, the Metropolitan Mus eum of Art in New York open ed a\\nthree-month spec ial exhibit in honor of Disney titled \"Inspiring Walt\\nDisney\".[215]\\nDisney received 59 Academy Award\\nnominations, inclu ding 22 awards: both totals\\nare records.[216] He was nominated for three\\nGolden Globe Awards , but did not win, but he\\nwas pres ented with two Special Achievement\\nAwards — for Bambi  (1942) and The Living\\nDesert  (1953) — and the Cecil B.

Several stories about the origins exist. Disney\\'s biographer , Bob\\nThomas , observes that \"The birth of Mickey Mouse is obscured in\\nlegend, much of it created by W alt Disney himself.\"[52]\\nh. The name Mortimer Mouse was used in the 1936 cartoon Mickey\\'s\\nRival  as a potential love-interest for Minnie Mouse . He was portrayed as\\na \"humorous denigration of the smooth city slicker\" with a smart car , but\\nfailed to win over Minnie from the more homespun Mickey .[54]\\ni. By 1931 he was called Michael Maus in Germany , Michel Souris in\\nFrance, Miguel Ratonocito or Miguel Pericote in Spain and Miki Kuchi in\\nJapan.[63]\\nj. $1.5 million in 1937 equates to $31,791,667 in 2024; $6.5 million in\\n1939 equates to $142,719,424 in 2024, according to calculations based\\non the Consumer Price Index  measure of inflation.[82]\\nk.

Even repeats of the program proved more popular than all other\\ntelevision shows—aside from Lucille Ball \\'s I Love Lucy ; no ABC\\nprogram had ever been in the top 25 before Disneyland .[117]\\ns. The program, which was produced by Ward Kimball , was nominated for\\nan Academy Award for the Best Documentary (Short Subject)  at the\\n1957 Awards .[126]\\nt. Disney\\'s death in 1966, and opposition from conservationists, stopped\\nthe building of the resort.[135]\\nu. A long-standing urban legend  maintains that Disney was cryonically\\nfrozen .[145] Disney\\'s daughter Diane later stated, \"There is absolutely no\\ntruth to the rumor that my father , Walt Disney , wished to be\\nfrozen.\"[146][147]\\nv. Roy died two months later , in December 1971.[153]\\nw. One possible exception to the stable relationship was during the making\\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs  (1937), where the stresses and\\nturmoil associated with the production led to the couple discussing\\ndivorce.[159]\\nx. Lillian had two miscarriages during the eight years between marriage\\nand the birth of Diane; she suf fered a further miscarriage shortly before\\nthe family adopted Sharon.[161]\\ny. Another example included animator Art Babbitt , organizer behind the\\n1941 strike at the studio and who held a well-known grudge against\\nDisney . Babbitt claimed in his later years that he saw Disney and his\\nlawyer attend meetings of the German American Bund , a pro-Nazi\\norganization, during the late 1930s.[186] However according to Gabler:\\n\"...that was highly unlikely , not only because W alt had little enough time\\nfor his family , much less political meetings, but because he had no real\\npolitical leanings at the time.\"[187] Disney\\'s of fice appointment book\\nmakes no mention of him attending Bund rallies, and no other\\nanimators ever made claims of Disney attending such meetings.[172]\\nz. Disney also demonstrated his political naivete in an October 1933 issue\\nof Overland Monthly  claiming: \"...there must be millions of people who\\nhave a downright feeling of animosity for our M. Mouse. Mr . A. Hitler ,\\nthe Nazi old thing, says that Mickey\\'s silly . Imagine that! W ell, Mickey is\\ngoing to save Mr . A Hitler from drowning or something some day . Just\\nwait and see if he doesn\\'t. Then won\\'t Mr . A. Hitler be\\nashamed!\"[172][189]\\naa.
